         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For, what will it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit a man to ſpend his Age in ſearching out of that, which he may have repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him at an instant? You may with one glance of your Eye runne over all the Writings and Pains ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by many Authours. And that nothing might be wanting, I have drawn forth
<pb facs="tcp:119698:4"/>the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> from the very <hi>Infancy</hi> of it, even unto the Death of <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Firſt, not following my own Advice, but directed by the Testimony of them, who, ſetting aſide all Envy, were Reall and Eye-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſses of this Tragedy. I have offered no Violence to the <hi>Truth,</hi> by ſiding with any part. If I loved the one, I did not hate the other. And if perhaps any Man (which in Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

                  <hi>Britans</hi> did ever now and then make ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, hardly ſubmitting their necks to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Government: Amongſt whom, for her Noble enterpriſe, <hi>Vaodicia</hi> the Queen was moſt remarkable; who, with her two daughters, Virgins, having formerly been forced by the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiery, in revenge for her chaſtity abuſed, raiſed a mighty Army, and over-threw the Enemy with a great ſlaughter; yet the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the Warre changing afterwards, ſhe eſcaped bondage provided for her, by drinking poyſon. This <hi>Iſland</hi> was ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Government five hundred years: but diſcord creeping in at home, they left this place of their own accord, which they had won with ſo much labour; yet they took ſuch <hi>Britans</hi> along with them, which they thought moſt fit for Warre, part whereof were ſlain in the Warre, part were conſumed with hunger and want, and part of them tranſported themſelves into that place in <hi>France</hi> for their ſafety, which from them is called <hi>Britany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> they ſtrive to enter upon the Countrey thus forſaken; whom to reſiſt, they choſe <hi>Vortigernus</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwall</hi> for their King, and implored the help of the <hi>Saxons</hi> or <hi>Anglo Saxons,</hi> a Warlick Nation in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> who were promiſcuouſly called by that Name: Theſe with <hi>Hengiſt</hi> and <hi>Horſus</hi> their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119698:10"/>Leaders, made haſt into <hi>England</hi> with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of 9000 men; by whoſe Valour, the <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> were overcome in a pitched Battell. From hence aroſe ſo great an opinion of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> that they were held for Angels, as it were, ſent from heaven; and they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into ſociety, by granting part of this <hi>Iſland</hi> unto them.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>Vortigernus</hi> being taken with the beauty of <hi>Rovena</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her for his Wife. <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> not a little elevated by this ſucceſs, forgetting his own Countrey, ſuppoſed himſelf to be King of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany;</hi> calling therefore not a few of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen out of <hi>Saxony,</hi> he attempted to gain the Land by force. But the Nobility of the Land foreſeeing theſe undertakings, they thruſt <hi>Vortigernus,</hi> an Uxorious King, from his Throne, and they create his ſonne <hi>Vortimer</hi> King. He ſuddenly picking up what Souldiers he could, went againſt the Enemy, near <hi>Alesfort,</hi> where in a ſingle fight, on one ſide <hi>Caligarnus</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Vortimer,</hi> on the other ſide <hi>Horſus</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Hengiſt</hi> were ſlain. The <hi>Saxons</hi> were compelled to forſake all <hi>Britany,</hi> or elſe a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory was granted to them in <hi>Tennet,</hi> where they found no quiet. <hi>Vortimer,</hi> to whom <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany</hi> now was indebted for her liberty, having reigned four years, was poyſoned by <hi>Rovena,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:119698:11"/>the Wife of <hi>Vortigernus;</hi> and the Nobility are perſwaded by a crafty woman to recall their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer King <hi>Vortigernus.</hi> This being done, <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt</hi> growing more bold by the favour of his Son in Law, levies a new Army, and again at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to invade <hi>Britany,</hi> cunningly pretending that he came not to wage Warre with the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> but to fetch <hi>Rovena,</hi> and to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual League with them. The falſe Name of League diſpleaſed not, the <hi>Britans</hi> came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed to the place appointed, but the <hi>Saxons</hi> came armed with ſhort skeens under their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; by this fraud theſe unprepared people were overcome without great conteſt, 300 of the Nobility were ſlain, the King himſelf was taken, and obtained his liberty by the Provinces of <hi>Kent, Suffolk, Suſſex,</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> but he himſelf fled into <hi>Wales</hi> In the mean while an infinite number of <hi>Saxons</hi> arrived in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,</hi> and they over flow the whole Iſland like a ſudden Deluge: untill ſuch time as <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> born, yet very affectionate to the <hi>Britans,</hi> landed in <hi>Britany</hi> with a great multitude of people; and at firſt, he ſets upon King <hi>Vortigernus</hi> ſuddenly, who was doubtleſs the cauſe of all theſe troubles; and beſieging him in a certain Caſtle, he put fire to it, and conſumed him with the Fort.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119698:12"/>for leaving his Grandfathers Kingdom of his own accord, he ſailed into <hi>Britany</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> by whoſe abſence the courage of the <hi>Saxons</hi> grew ſo great, that coming in with great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, they vanquiſhed the <hi>Britans,</hi> that were now without a King, and they eaſily brought the whole Iſland under their Juriſdiction. <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walladar</hi> ſtriving to ſtand againſt their violence, was admoniſhed (as it is ſuppoſed) from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to betake himſelf to a ſpiritual life, where he died a Monk. The <hi>Saxons</hi> being now Maſters of all, divide this vaſt Iſland into ſeven Kingdoms, and as many Kings; yet he that was moſt powerfull was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led King of <hi>England,</hi> ſo that it is apparent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that in this Heptarchy there was a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. And now the Chriſtian Religion had taken no ſmall root, (the clouds of Heatheniſh Errours being diſperſed) by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Auſtin,</hi> the Engliſh Apoſtle, as they called him; And this light was received by the Engliſh men with ſo great zeal, that they ſtrove to enter their Names, built Churches, and performed Divine duties.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Saxon</hi> Government flouriſhed exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly under this Heptarchy for a long time; untill that inteſtine Warre roſe amongſt them, and brought all things under the power of the <hi>Weſt Saxons.</hi> For <hi>Egbert,</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119698:12"/>Saxons,</hi> when he had by Arms ſubdued four Kingdoms, and was in hope to overcome the other two; in memory of his Country, after the Name of <hi>Britans</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that all the Inhabitants ſhould be called <hi>Engliſh men,</hi> and the Countrey <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the affairs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſeemed to be at the height, when they were next to their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; ſo falſe is the appearance of all humane things, that when they glitter moſt, they may be ſuppoſed to be in the declining. For the <hi>Danes</hi> playing the Pirats about the Engliſh Coaſts for a long time, at laſt by force they enter the Land, <hi>Angarus</hi> and <hi>Hubo</hi> being their Captains, and they waſted the Countrey miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, ſparing neither ſacred nor common, which is apparent by a moſt famous example of the holy Virgins of <hi>Coldingham,</hi> who to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their purity, diſmembred their bodies. For foreſeeing the violence of the mad ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers every where, they cut off their own noſtrils and their upper lips, that being like to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they might mitigate the diſhoneſt laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of an unbeleeving Nation. The Kings of the <hi>Mercians</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern Engliſh</hi> were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by them; and their Kingdoms were poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with no ſmall part of <hi>Northumberland:</hi> at laſt to repreſs the inſolency of theſe <hi>Danes,</hi> a great Tribute was laid upon the people, which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119698:13"/>was commonly called <hi>Dan</hi> or <hi>Dans gelt.</hi> At length they were valiantly repulſed by <hi>Alfred</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> and are driven out of all <hi>Mercia.</hi> Upon his Victories <hi>Edward</hi> his Sonne ſucceeding, ſubdued the Eaſt part of <hi>England,</hi> driving out the <hi>Danes.</hi> But <hi>Adelſtan</hi> this Kings Baſtard Sonne, caſt ſuch a fear upon them, that they yielded not only <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but alſo all <hi>England</hi> unto him; and ſome of them became his ſubjects willingly. But <hi>Ethelrede</hi> a weak and ſluggiſh King reigning, taking heart again, they once more invade the Land, ſpoil and waſt it miſerably, whereby the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were provoked to conſpire together, and ſo in one night they killed all the <hi>Danes,</hi> through the whole Iſland, and quencht ſo great a fire with the blood of the Authors of it. <hi>Swain</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> being urged with this great ſlaughter of his ſubjects, invades <hi>England</hi> with a mighty Army. He puts <hi>Ethelrede</hi> to flight, and brought the whole Land under his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and by his death he paſſed it over to his Sonne <hi>Canatus,</hi> who fought with <hi>Ethelrede</hi> (who came back again with his Son <hi>Edmundus</hi>) upon a changeable fortune, and left his two Sons to ſucceed him, <hi>Harald</hi> his baſtard, and <hi>Canutus</hi> the Bold; but when they were dead, the Kingdom returned again unto the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who ſhook off the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Yoke: and <hi>Edward</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:119698:13"/>Sonne to <hi>Ethelred</hi> was made King. Now it was that <hi>England</hi> began to take breath; but as it commonly fals out, idleneſs became the ruine of many: The lazy Prieſts, for the moſt part, being at eaſe, took care of all things but their Office. The people being more diſſolute with Luxury, grew contemptible by ſluggiſh dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Learning decaied, the Commonwealth waſted with divers Vices, Pride and Negligence had made a ready path for their Ruine.</p>

                  <hi>Toſto</hi> ſtrove againſt him all he could, and made Warre with him; but at <hi>York</hi> he loſt his life in a pitched Battell. In the mean while, <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> depending on his right, raiſing an Army, came for <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>South Saxons: Harold</hi> hearing of his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall, though his Souldiers were tired with a late fight, ſets up his Standard againſt his new gueſt <hi>William.</hi> Not farre from <hi>Haſtings</hi> they fought a ſore Battel; but fortune turning againſt the <hi>Engliſh, Harold</hi> driven forward with a Warlike fury, riding into the midſt of the Enemies, and fighting valiantly, was ſlain, and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his men were ſlain with him. <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour preſently brings his Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Banners to <hi>London,</hi> and is proclaimed King by the people that remained, having got a Kingdom by a lawfull Victory, which (as he ſaid) was given him by God. This King (which is the uſe for Conquerours to do) abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing forthwith all the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and the greateſt part of their Laws, brought in immediatly his own Countrey fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions, and commanded that all Cauſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould be pleaded in <hi>French:</hi> And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that had born Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him out of their Patrimonies, he diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of all their Demeans, Lands, Fields, and the reſt of their Goods amongſt his Souldiers
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119698:14"/>for a reward of their Victory; but reſerving to himſelf the direct Principality and Homage, held to Himſelf and his Heirs, as a tenure from the Crown; ſo that none but the King ſhould be the right and true Lord of any thing. Alſo he cauſed a ſeal to be made for himſelf, wherein was engraved, <hi>By this acknowledge</hi> William <hi>of</hi> Normandy <hi>to be your Patron:</hi> but on the other ſide was engraven, <hi>By this ſeal you muſt know that the ſame is King of</hi> England. Having thus ſubdued the power of the Laity, he turns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Clergy, and made an Edict, that no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monk ſhould be capable of any ſecular Dignity, diſdaining the facilneſs of <hi>Canutus,</hi> who was formerly King, who had continued the honours entire to the people whom he had ſubdued; by which lenity the inhabitants grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bold, after his death eaſily expelled forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and recovered their former Liberty.</p>
               <p>Then he appeaſed the approaching Warre of the <hi>Danes,</hi> by giving them money, that he might enjoy it peaceably upon any rate. And hence it was that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were in no fear at all of the <hi>Danes</hi> that formerly ſo much infeſted them: yet they were not ſo free from troubles, but that here or there, there were ſome tumults amongſt the people, that were hardly ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and overcome, but the windy faction was ſoon diſperſed.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:119698:15"/>
               <p>The greateſt matter was the Rebellion of his Sonne <hi>Robert</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> becauſe it was moſt againſt Nature. This Sonne at the inſtigation of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> demanded this Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his Father as his proper right; and without more words enters upon <hi>Normandy</hi> by force of Arms. It is true his Father had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him this Territory, but the Son was weary of delay, nor would he longer forbear from the Government he hoped for. The King hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Sons Enterprize, ſuddenly goes againſt him with a gallant Army; They meet in Battel, the Son unhorſes his Father, and wounds him in the Arm. But when he knew his Fathers voice, alighting from his own horſe, he raiſed his Father from the ground, and kneeling down before him, craved pardon for his boldneſs, which he obtained preſently, his Father embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him in his Arms. However he ſeemed thus to have appeaſed his Fathers wrath, yet God never ſuffering ſuch faults to go unpuniſhed, he had no good luck ever after. <hi>William,</hi> by ſuch clemency, was miraculouſly eminent, in other caſes, raiſing not a few of his adverſaries, (a rare example) to the greateſt Dignities, as if he endeavoured by his gentleneſs to mitigate their fierce ſpirits, and to calm their rebellious mindes, that they might be eminent in their duty to their Benefactor, as he was in beſtowing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119698:15"/>benefits on his enemies, and ſhould bluſh to deny obedience unto him, whom they had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, without danger.

Yet leaſt the frowardneſs of his newly conquered ſubjects ſhould grow inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, he laid upon them Taxes and Tributes that were not very light, and for the honour of his own Country, he made the Laws to be debated in the <hi>French</hi> tongue, and be bridled the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of the Monks. Only the men of <hi>Kent</hi> held their old Cuſtoms: For the King upon a certain time journying toward <hi>Dover,</hi> was handſomly circumvented by the Inhabitants of <hi>Kent,</hi> carrying boughs cut down from the trees, and they would not let him depart untill he had granted them the enjoyment of their Antient Cuſtoms. Alſo he was indulgent to the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners,</hi> to let them enjoy the priviledges they had in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor; but he forbad the Nobility from hunting of Deer, reſerving thoſe ſports for himſelf only.</p>
               <p>He diſpoſed no leſs of Church affairs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a difference between the Archbiſhops of

                  <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> for that this was ſubject to that; and ever after the Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> was called Primate of <hi>England,</hi> and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Primate of all <hi>England.</hi> Alſo he made the Churches of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be under the Primate of <hi>York,</hi> as the Churches of <hi>England</hi> were under <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though he ſeemed to curb the inſolency of the Clergy, he had them yet in great eſteem: For <hi>Aldred</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> being angry becauſe he could not obtain what he asked, and offering to go away in a fury, the King not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during the hatred of that Prelate, fell down at his knees, and humbly asked forgiveneſs of him. The Biſhop being admoniſhed to raiſe up the King, anſwered, No, but ſaid, He ſhall feel what it is to offend S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter.</hi> By the largeneſs of his Benefits he ſhewed forth the love he bare unto Church men, building innumerable Churches for the ſervice of God, with Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and other ſacred Houſes.</p>
               <p>About the end of his life and Kingdom he placed his two Sons <hi>Robert</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> almoſt in equal power over <hi>Normandy.</hi> There aroſe on a day a quarrel between <hi>Henry,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Dolphin of <hi>France,</hi> playing at Tables, which was the cauſe of a great contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Normans:</hi> The Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin drawing <hi>Robert</hi> on his ſide, enters <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi>

                  <hi>WIlliam</hi> whoſe ſirname was <hi>Rufus,</hi> the third Son, ſucceeded the Conquerour. The beginning of his Reign was unquiet and troubleſom, his Brother <hi>Robert</hi> being offended with him, for taking the ſucceſſion from him; the Nobility being divided, and conſpiring his deſtruction. But he freed himſelf of all this danger, partly by force, partly by rewards, and partly by Armes, ſo that he pacified them all.</p>
               <p>But the greater Tempeſt was threatned from <hi>Scotland,</hi> now ready to ariſe, for <hi>Malcom</hi> King of the <hi>Scots,</hi> though he ought homage to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> conjecturing, amongſt ſo many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that he had now a fit opportunity to be proſperous in his buſineſs, with great force entred <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and with fire and ſword he conſumed all he met with; and loaded with ſpoils, he returned into his Countrey. But <hi>William</hi> having provided an Army, invaded <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſubduing <hi>Malcom,</hi> brought him at laſt to his obedience, and made him give Hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for ſecurity.</p>

                  <hi>Robert</hi> the Kings Brother, once more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims Warre againſt him, becauſe he paid him not the money they were agreed upon; and the King of <hi>France</hi> taking his part, he took ſome Towns by force from his Brother, which of right belonged to him. But <hi>William</hi> bribed the <hi>French</hi> King, and ſo depriving his Brother of all help, eaſily compelled him to crave pardon for his Retractayners.</p>
               <p>But that all things might take their turns, <hi>Malcom,</hi> taking occaſion of raiſing Arms from the contempt of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> provoked <hi>William</hi> by a new injury, ſpoyling his Countrey: But when, being loaden with the ſpoil, he thought to return home, by chance being intercepted by Ambuſh, he loſt both his life, and the Prize he had got. But yet this put not an end to the Troubles, for the <hi>Welſh</hi> ſetting upon the King already incumbred, depopulated his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the way, whom at laſt <hi>William</hi> overcame in a ſucceſsfull Battel.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Robert Mowbray,</hi> by whoſe valour <hi>Malcom</hi> was ſubdued, ſuppoſing himſelf to be deſpiſed, or not ſo much honoured as he deſerved, procuring ſome other Noble men to joyn with him, riſeth up againſt his Sovereign; but the King ſuddenly falling upon the ſmall number of the Conſpirators, eaſily put an end to this tumultuous Warre, taking <hi>Mowbray</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:119698:18"/>priſoner. Yet leaſt the <hi>Welſh</hi> ſhould riſe again afreſh, however their ſtubborneſs was beaten down, and ſhould occaſion greater danger, <hi>William</hi> now endeavours wholly to Conquer them, invading their Kingdom, and building of Bulwarks; but when this Warre proved to be tedious, the buſineſs being recommended to <hi>Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> and to the Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> the King left them: They cruelly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Wolſh,</hi> cutting off their noſtrils and their ears, untill ſuch time as the Earl of <hi>Shropſhire</hi> being ſlain, <hi>Hugh</hi> Count of <hi>Cheſter</hi> killing the King of <hi>Wales,</hi> obtain'd a full Victory over them.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Lanfranc</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> lived, he was ruled as with a bridle, but after he was dead, being, as it were, freed from all bands, the ſtate of the Church being oppreſſed, he began to rage with immoderate Tributes, and hard Laws: Now was the firſt time that all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall preferments were ſet to ſale, and any thing was lawfull for money. Yet the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of this King was not wholly void of doing good, for he gave freely to a poor Monk a Benefice, for which two others contended vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, beating the bargain with great ſummes of money.</p>
               <p>However all theſe vices were made good by his great Magnanimity, for hearing of the ſiege
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119698:18"/>of the Town of <hi>Mantium,</hi> breaking through a Wall, that he might the ſooner enter, none following him but ſuch as were couragious like himſelf, and deſpiſing the danger of the turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sea, he came unexpected, and freed the place, putting the enemy to flight, and taking their Captain priſoner, who was <hi>Helias</hi> Earl of <hi>Fleſcia.</hi> That Earl when he ſaw himſelf capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, imputed this his misfortune to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for arrivall of the King, threatning great matters againſt the King if he were once at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, whereupon he was ſet free to do what he could.</p>
               <p>Alſo he ſhewed a wonderfull example of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table courage at a Fort call'd S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Michaels</hi> Mount, for he was ſuddenly ſet upon by three Cavaliers, and although he was already unhorſed, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelf valiantly with his Saddle for a Target, and his drawn Sword, untill ſuch time as he was reſcued by his followers. When as thoſe that accompanied him found fault with his too great care for his Saddle, <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I would rather have loſt my life, than have left that to the ſcorn of the Enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was faithfull in his promiſe; betwixt both in continence, he neither deſpiſed nor yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored Religion, but he was extream covetous. This was the firſt King of <hi>England</hi> that would look into the faults of the Clergy, and reſerved
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119698:19"/>to himſelf the puniſhing of them, neglecting the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſt of all, being much given to hunting, he was unhappily ſlain by an arrow that rebounded from the back of a Stag. The foreſhewing ſigns of his unhappy end being foreſeen, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>

Who in the abſence of his elder Brother <hi>Robert,</hi> either invaded the Kingdom, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it with money, or obtained it by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the people; for he was more Learned than all his Brothers, and was ſo much the more dear to the people. He made good the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he had got with fraud, by good deeds, gentleneſs, and juſt puniſhments: He every where preferred Learned men for places in the Church; he removed ſuch as were unlearned and unworthy from their places: He mitigated the more ſevere Laws, and aboliſhed hard Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms. He granted the Nobility free leave to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119698:19"/>Hunt; and with his bounty he ſo won the hearts of all. And becauſe he knew that the <hi>Scotch</hi> were his ill-willers, he made peace with them, and to binde the League the faſter, he took <hi>Maud</hi> the ſiſter of King <hi>Edgar</hi> to be his Wife. That which hapned to his Father and to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, hapned to him, to have the firſt ſucceſs of Warre from his own kindred. Namely the Biſhop of <hi>Durrham</hi> being the firſt mover of it, (whom he had caſt into priſon for exacting too great Tributes) who had eſcaped his Keepers by reaſon of their neglect, his Brother <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> is ſtirred up to wage Warre with <hi>Henry,</hi> and to recover his right. <hi>Robert</hi> was now ready in <hi>England</hi> with an Army, and the day for the Battel was appointed, when as the Heralds were ſent up and down, at laſt peace is agreed upon, 20000 Franks being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted yearly to <hi>Robert,</hi> and hopes of ſucceſſion, ſhould he out live his Brother <hi>Henry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This danger ſcarce diſpelled, another fals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neck of it: For <hi>Robert Bellamy</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi> for no other cauſe but envy, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Welſh</hi> to his aid, makes Warre againſt the King: But this ſtopped him not, for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an Army ſuddenly, he put the <hi>Welſh</hi> to flight, he intercepted <hi>Robert,</hi> and confiſcating all his Goods, ſent him into baniſhment: For to puniſh Traitors with death was not yet the faſhion.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:119698:20"/>
               <p>The third tempeſt aroſe from <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Mortane</hi> and of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> the Kings Uncle, he being angry with his Coſen for denying him the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> endeavours by treachery to draw the Shire unto himſelf; but his Treaſon being diſcovered, for one County that he thought to win he loſt two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> that was hitherto on the defenſive part, now takes up Arms willingly againſt his Brother <hi>Robert,</hi> being offended at ſome ſcoff of his, and levying an Army he entred <hi>Normandy,</hi> and became Maſter of it all, ſcarce leaving ſo much as <hi>Roan</hi> to his Brother, and ſo he retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>England.

But <hi>Henry,</hi> either offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the now freſh injury of his Brother, or elſe affecting the Dukedom of <hi>Normandy,</hi> neglected the praiers of his Brother. <hi>Robert</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impatient of this ſcorn returns for <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and once more raiſing an Army, attempts a Warre againſt his Brother; but he coming ſucceſsfully upon <hi>Robert</hi> with a ſufficient force, providently ſuppreſſed the miſchief in the birth, but not without blood; and he carried his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Captive into <hi>England,</hi> and putting out his eyes, he held him priſoner to the day of his death.</p>

After this Peace followed between both theſe Kings, the Dukedom of <hi>Normandy</hi> being granted to <hi>William</hi> the Son of <hi>Henry,</hi> doing Homage for it. And thus by continuance of time all the firſt-born Sonnes of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are ſtyled Dukes of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy.</hi> But <hi>Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> being wickedly ſlain at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> leaving no other Heir, <hi>William</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Robert,</hi> who was the next right Heir to it (for that he was from the blood of <hi>Maud</hi> Daughter to <hi>Baldwin,</hi> and Wife to <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour) was elevated to this Dignity, who growing inſolent with this proſperity, endeavours to recover <hi>Normandy</hi> his Patrimony by his Grandfather; which he brought to paſs with no great difficulty, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119698:21"/>of the <hi>French</hi> King; but receiving a wound in one of his hands, which was very ſmal, and afterwards rankling, he loſt both his life and Patrimony by it.</p>
               <p>Peace being confirmed abroad, yet <hi>Henry</hi> was toſſed at home with civil commotions, <hi>Wales</hi> being entred into a Conſpiracy, whereupon he purſuing the Rebels, erring in his paſſage, he fell into a ſtraight place, and redeemed, yet not without danger, a thouſand ſheep and oxen from them. And theſe were the Warres he had both at home and abroad.</p>
               <p>He ſeldom or never Taxed the Land: He made none but good Laws: He was the firſt that ordained the convening of the ſeveral Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which is now called a Parliament. He pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Theeves, and falſe Coiners with ſevere juſtice: He diminiſhed the power of the Pope in his Dominions, and ſuch ſuits as were deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>England,</hi> he forbad to be called back to <hi>Rome</hi> without his cognizance thereof, the Pope not ſpeaking any thing againſt it. But a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Controverſie aroſe concerning Eccleſiaſtical Promotions, both of them ſtanding ſtoutly for his own Intereſt: But the King not regarding the Pope, held in his own hands the power of diſpoſing and confirming Offices.</p>
               <p>If he were over luxunious, yet he was noble in his choice, not loving every one in extreams.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:119698:21"/>
               <p>He had no lawfully begotten Sons, but he had many baſtards, whereupon he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all means to eſtabliſh the Government in <hi>Maude</hi> and her Daughters, but all in vain; <hi>Stephen</hi> ſucceeding, who was born from <hi>Adela,</hi> Daughter to <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Maude</hi> his Wife and Daughter, which firſt married <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, and he being dead, ſhe was married to <hi>Jeffrey Plantagenet,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Fulc</hi> the Duke of <hi>Aniou.</hi>

               <p>He was ſcarce Crowned, before he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fall to his Arms; for <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſtriving to aſſert the Intereſt of <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſs, proclaimed Warre againſt <hi>Stephen,</hi> and poſſeſſed himſelf of the Towns of <hi>Carlile</hi> and <hi>New-caſtle.

Alſo <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> forgetfull of his Covenant, enters upon <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and miſerably made havock of all by fire and ſword, he neither ſpared women nor innocent children, he kils the Prieſts before the Altars, the ſacred Virgins are raviſhed in the Churches.</p>
               <p>The King to oppoſe himſelf againſt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt danger, firſt bends his forces againſt the <hi>Scots.</hi> But the Warre during long, giving command to <hi>Thurſtin</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> to wage Warre with the <hi>Scots,</hi> he returned home that he might tame the reſt of the Rebels, which by force of Arms, by Promiſes, and by his Benevolence, he at laſt reclaimed. <hi>Thurſtin</hi> in the mean time, joyning Battell, ſubdued the <hi>Scots,</hi> and ſlew them with a great ſlaughter, for eleven thouſand <hi>Scots</hi> were ſlain in the fight, beſides thoſe that ran away and were killed in the purſuit. The King being made more bold by this ſucceſs, enters now with Arms upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> and afflicted <hi>David</hi> with a ſore loſs, and compelled him to beg for peace, which at laſt he yielded to; <hi>Stephen</hi> taking <hi>Henry</hi> the Son to <hi>David</hi> for Hoſtage. <hi>Stephen</hi> returning laid ſiege to <hi>Ludlow,</hi> the receptacle for the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, and with his own hand he freed <hi>Henry</hi> whom he had taken for a pledge.</p>
               <p>The moſt cruel tempeſt followed this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119698:23"/>for <hi>Maude</hi> requiring her Right, arrived in <hi>England: Stephen</hi> hearing this, laies ſiege to <hi>Arundel</hi> Caſtle, where by chance ſhe harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf; but in this deſperate ſiege, water being all ſpent, <hi>Maude</hi> delivers up the Caſtle, having leave given her to retire towards <hi>Briſtol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean while he quickly removes to <hi>Lincoln,</hi> taken by <hi>Randulph,</hi> Sonne to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and environs it with a ſiege: The Earls of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to free the City, fight with <hi>Stephen</hi> hand to hand, in which fight, <hi>Stephen</hi> is taken priſoner, after that he had given wonderfull arguments of his proweſs; and he is brought before <hi>Maud,</hi> who ſent him toward <hi>Briſtol</hi> to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and ſhe in the mean while poſſeſſeth the Kingdom, entring <hi>London</hi> as Conquerour in Triumph.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Maude</hi> or <hi>Mathilde,</hi> the wife of <hi>Stephen,</hi> hearing of the Kings misfortune, humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated <hi>Maud,</hi> that ſhe being of a long time weary of the Government, might have liberty to live with her Husband a private life. Alſo the <hi>Londoners,</hi> they require their antient Laws which they enjoyed under <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor;</hi> but <hi>Maud</hi> would grant neither. <hi>Maud</hi> not enduring the high ſtomack of <hi>Mathilde,</hi> and deteſting ignoble ſervitude, cals for <hi>Euſtachius</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:119698:24"/>her Sonne, with a ſelect company of Souldiers out of <hi>Kent</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> who joyning with the <hi>Londoners,</hi> that were wonderfully offended that their ſuits were denied them, alſo fortifying himſelf with the help of the Biſhop of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> they fall upon the Army of <hi>Mathilde,</hi> which fled privately to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and asked not help in vain of <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by whoſe aſſiſtance her Army being increaſed, ſhe beſieged <hi>Wincheſter:</hi> But the Queen with her Sonne <hi>Euſtachius,</hi> falling on her fortreſs, overcame <hi>Mathilde</hi> in a pitched Battell, and took <hi>Robert</hi> Sonne to <hi>Mathilde,</hi> but <hi>Mathilde</hi> her ſelf eſcaped luckily. A Treaty for Peace followed this fortune, whereby <hi>Robert</hi> on the one hand, <hi>Stephen</hi> on the other are ſet at liberty; but there was no other condition agreed upon, wherefore the Trumpet ſounds again to Warre, and <hi>Stephen</hi> being now free, beſieges <hi>Mathilde</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> but ſhe deſpiſing danger, paſſed through his Army in the night. Yet ſhe was ſo frighted with the preſent danger, that ſhe ever after forbare to make Warre with him, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the charge of the whole buſineſs to her Son <hi>Henry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean while the City of <hi>Lincoln</hi> was valiantly defended againſt the King. But at laſt the Earl willingly yielded to the King, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring reconciliation; yet <hi>Stephen</hi> entertained
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119698:24"/>him not ſo courteouſly, but ſpoil'd the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Earl of all his Eſtate; by which perjury he did not a little alienate the mindes of his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> by the death of his Father <hi>Jeffrey,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got the Dukedom of <hi>Aniou</hi> and of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> and with his Wife <hi>Eleonar</hi> the County of <hi>Poicteirs,</hi> by a freſh attempt, but with a few Souldiers ſails for <hi>England,</hi> hoping at laſt to regain his Grandfathers Kingdom. He was no ſooner landed, but his friends came flocking to him every way, and being fortified with new helps, he laies ſiege to <hi>Malmeſbury,</hi> but the King coming upon him with more forces, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the ſewer forces of the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Here is a thing to be rightly wonder'd at, amongſt drawn ſwords Peace began to ſhew her ſelf, <hi>Stephen</hi> procured reſt by granting, which he could not obtain by Victories; and <hi>Henry</hi> obtained that Kingdom peaceably, which he ſought for by Warre: For whilſt here and there, with equal endeavours they wage Warre, <hi>Euſtachius</hi> ſuddenly died, and <hi>Stephen</hi> being deprived of an Heir to ſucceed him, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with mourning, he willingly entred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace with <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Mathilde,</hi> whereby he aſſigned his Enemy to be his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour, and adopted him for his Sonne, being he had none nearer of blood unto him; ſo
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119698:25"/>little faith or conſtancy is there in humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, they that but now fought with all their might, do now embrace one the other, and <hi>Stephen</hi> recovers his loſt Sonne, by adopting his Enemy. So <hi>Henry</hi> ſeeking ſo great a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by Warre, found both the Kingdom and a Father in Peace.</p>
               <p>The affairs of <hi>England</hi> were too troubleſom for <hi>Stephen</hi> to exact Tribute from his ſubjects, yet he abundantly recompenſed this loſs, by ſtoring the Exchequer with the goods of the Rebels. He made no Laws, when as by reaſon of a continuall Warre, he ſeemed more ready to receive than to give: Yet he had no greater Victory than over the Clergy, whoſe obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and pride he regulated, and made them good ſubjects. He that had lived in Warre and contention, ought not to die without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and neglect; for he had ſcarce made Peace with <hi>Henry,</hi> but he was afreſh ſeized on by his old diſeaſe of the Emrods and the Cholick, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not been free from Warre one year, he died at <hi>Dover.</hi>

He behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wiſely when he began to Reign, chooſing the wiſeſt men for his Counſellours, expelling ſtrangers that came in hopes of rapine, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe of <hi>Flanders,</hi> demoliſhing the Caſties that the Nobility had built, at the connivance of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> which they had often abuſed to ſedition.

The Demeans which were beſtowed upon thoſe that were unworthy of them, by Licence from King <hi>Stephen,</hi> he took to himſelf, and ſo he ſpared his ſubjects from Tributes, thinking it ſafer to offend a few than many. He had yet no Competitors, and ſo was ſafer from Incurſions and Rebellions. The <hi>Welſh</hi> made ſome rude commotion, who were no ſooner up, but he ſubdued them. He made offenſive Warre againſt <hi>Malcom</hi> King of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119698:26"/>
                  <hi>Scots,</hi> and drove him out by force from <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> the City of <hi>Carlile</hi> and <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> which King <hi>Stephen</hi> had granted him.</p>
               <p>He left him <hi>Huntington</hi> to do him homage for it, for <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> ſake, who was dead. He took by force from his Brother <hi>Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey,</hi> after his Fathers death, the Dukedom of <hi>Anion</hi> which his Father had granted him upon intreaty, having the Popes indulgence to break his Oath.</p>
               <p>Then he attempts to take to himſelf, from <hi>Raymundus</hi> Earl of a place conſecrated to Saint <hi>Aegidius,</hi> the Dukedom of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> which of right belonged unto him, and when <hi>Lewis</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> would help <hi>Raymund,</hi> he wages Warre with them both. Now the Armies were ready for battel, but at the mediation of friends peace is at laſt concluded, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> is granted to <hi>Raymund</hi> for a time, a Marriage being made between <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Englands</hi> Son, and <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter to King <hi>Lewis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he managed all things wiſely hitherto, now he doth order his matters as fooliſhly, taking his Son <hi>Henry</hi> into the Government with him. For <hi>Lewis</hi> ſcorning the puſillanimity of his Son in Law, that he would permit his Father to be equal with him in the Kingdom, and would himſelf be a titular King only, he eaſily infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119698:26"/>his youthfull minde that was ready to take fire with unlawfull deſires. This envy had now broke forth into open hate, and the Son began to cavil at all the Father either did or ſaid. Nor was the Sonnes ingratitude unknown to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; wherefore meſſengers being ſent to <hi>Lewis,</hi> he endeavoured to oppreſs and extinguiſh thoſe beginnings of diſcord. But <hi>Lewis</hi> laught at the words of the Embaſſadours, asking ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully why they call'd him their Maſter, who had freely delivered up his right to his Sonne, and ſo diſmiſſed them without any other anſwer. To this there was joined the malice of Queen <hi>Eleoner</hi> that ſhe bare him, by reaſon that he loved whores, whereby ſhe inſtigated her other two Sons, <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Jeffrey,</hi> that they ſhould aſſiſt the Son againſt the Father.</p>
               <p>They fled to <hi>Henry</hi> into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire jointly againſt their Father. Alſo <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scotland, Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter, Roger Mowbray, Hugh Bigot</hi> and others fell from him, <hi>Henry</hi> with this augmentation grew more bold, and now provides open Warre againſt his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Fortune was changeable in divers Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, both courage and fraud being employed in the Warres. But <hi>Richard</hi> who had fallen off from his Father, repenting of his errour, came to him, and craved pardon, which he eaſily obtain'd; at laſt ſome of the Rebels being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119698:27"/>and the <hi>Scotch</hi> vanquiſhed, Peace is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed between the Father and the Sonne, at the Mediation of <hi>Richard, Adela</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Lewis</hi> being married to <hi>Richard.</hi> And ſo <hi>Henry</hi> returned into <hi>England</hi> with his Sons, where <hi>Henry</hi> his eldeſt Sonne died, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lict is ſent home again into <hi>France</hi> to her Father, and afterwards ſhe was married to the King of <hi>Hungary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Richard</hi> taking it ill that his Marriage was ſo long deferred (for the Father by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull luſt was ſuppoſed to keep <hi>Adela</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, continually putting off the Matrimony) fell again into the ſame Rebellion which he had renounced by Oath. And being confederate with his Brother <hi>John,</hi> and with <hi>Philip</hi> then King of <hi>France,</hi> he makes Warre with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at <hi>Ments</hi> he beſieged the old King, who ſlipt away in the night, and thought, though in vain, to raiſe the ſiege, at laſt the Town is delivered into the enemies hands, to his greater loſs, becauſe King <hi>Henry</hi> was born in that Town: Wherefore, either by reaſon of his power broken, or by the loſs of his native City, his Majeſty being eclipſed, he that had hitherto given Laws, was now forced to take Laws from the enemy. And theſe are the Wars that he waged.</p>
               <p>This King ſubdued <hi>Ireland</hi> without ſpilling
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119698:27"/>blood, Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding it, and he built a magnificent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace at <hi>Dublin</hi> for the uſe of his Poſterity.</p>
               <p>He augmented his Treaſure more by Confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Parſimony, than by Tributes and Impoſts. Becauſe he was too ſparing toward his children, it is ſuppoſed that gave them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to revolt, but he left an infinite Treaſure when he died, and recompenſed abundantly the want they had ſuſtained.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of his Reign he cut off ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the ſeverity of the Laws, and he erected new Tribunals for the uſe of his ſubjects, and he firſt commanded the Lions to be kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> which cuſtom is continued to this day.</p>
               <p>He brought the Clergy under the Magiſtrate, though <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> ſtood ſtifly againſt it, who for that was baniſhed, and received into favour again by the Interceſſion of the Pope and the King of <hi>France,</hi> but when he would not yield to the Kings pleaſure, he was miſerably butcherd by four Souldiers of horſe, but after his death he was conſecrated for a Saint. <hi>Henry</hi> alſo being wrapt up with the love of luxury and of whores, had his Wife alwaies his enemy, which he at laſt impriſoned, becauſe ſhe had ſuborned her Sons to Rebel.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King ſent him a Catalogue of all
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119698:28"/>thoſe Rebels that conſpired his death; and when firſt of all he ſaw the Name of his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſonne <hi>John,</hi> he ſunk down half dead with grief, and the affliction increaſing he died of it, being above threeſcore years old, and had ruled the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> thirty five years.</p>

               <p>Alſo <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> invaded <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> with an Army as he had promiſed. He ſought to draw <hi>John</hi> the Kings Brother to his ſide, but could not, his Mother <hi>Eleoner</hi> diſſwading him. But though he openly did nothing to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers prejudice, yet privately, a falſe rumour being ſpread of the Kings death through <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he endeavours to wreſt the Kingdom from him, whereby afterwards he loſt all the favour he had with his Brother, together with his Honour. The King after this goes againſt King <hi>Philip</hi> with a great Navy, and firſt he freed the City <hi>Vernowle,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſme</hi> from his Leauger ſo haſtily, that the <hi>French</hi> man leaving for fear all his Baggage, ran away. At laſt a Peace being made between both, they are forced to abſtain from Warre, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wils.</p>
               <p>In the mean while his Kingdom was toſſed with various commotions. Firſt, by Theeves, the chief whereof being killed, that faction was eaſily ſuppreſſed. Secondly, by a greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion from the Jews, ariſing from one that had forſworn the ſuperſtition of his Anceſtors; for the reſt of the Jews being offended at it, who continued in their errour, could hardly tolerate their converted Brother, they meet him in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119698:31"/>high-way, and fine him ſorely, whence firſt grew a Faction, then a Tumult, and ſlaughter of the Jews every where. Nor was this rage ſhut up in one Town, but paſſing the bounds, it went firſt to <hi>Stamfort,</hi> then to <hi>Lincoln,</hi> then to <hi>York,</hi> where the Jews flying into a Caſtle, killing firſt their Wives and Children moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly, and caſting their dead bodies out of the windows on the enemies heads; putting fire to Gun-powder, they were almoſt all blown up, a cruel example of their ſtubbornneſs.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It is a queſtion whether the King were more angry with the commotion, or with the puniſhment of Covetouſneſs, whereby he found an end for all his troubles. A certain Souldier who <hi>received wages</hi> from King <hi>Richard</hi> had found a mighty Treaſure, and fearing leaſt the King ſhould demand it, he went to <hi>Lemoſin,</hi> and hid it in the Town of <hi>Calacum,</hi> when the Towns men prolonged to let the King come in, he laid ſiege to it, whereby receiving a wound in his Arm, he died ſhortly after of it, having won the City, but not found the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>He was of a reaſonable Stature, of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and gracefull countenance, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in manners, famous more for his Vertues than Vices, ſparing of Tribute, but very cunning to raiſe Money. He was the firſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119698:31"/>that ſubjected the City of <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Aldermen</hi> and <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> blotting out the Name of <hi>Potent Earls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>JOHN <hi>the first, King of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1201.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>RIchard</hi> being dead, <hi>John</hi> invades the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by right of Anticipation, ſhutting out his Couſin <hi>Arthur,</hi> to whom the ſucceſſion was due by right of Inheritance, and alſo by the prerogative of his age, for <hi>Arthur</hi> was not yet over thirteen years old. Alſo truſting to his Bribes (for he had robbed thoſe Treaſures his Brother had compiled) he entred the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his own accord, (not caring any thing for the envy of his ſubjects) his friends in <hi>England</hi> not a little helping him.</p>
               <p>The firſt Tempeſt was depending from his Couſin <hi>Arthur,</hi> whoſe Kingdom he had not only taken from him, but alſo had drawn the Dukedom of <hi>Normandy</hi> to himſelf, leaving on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Dukedom of <hi>Anion</hi> to the childe. Alſo his Mother <hi>Conſtance</hi> finding her ſelf too weak for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> flies to the <hi>French</hi> King, and craves aid of him, who promiſed not only to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119698:32"/>reſtore all <hi>Normandy,</hi> but all <hi>England</hi> alſo to <hi>Arthur,</hi> and received the young man into his protection: Wherefore <hi>Philip</hi> liſting an Army, firſt made good the Duchy of <hi>Aniou</hi> to <hi>Arthur,</hi> and then he invaded <hi>Normandy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>John</hi> ſailing into <hi>Normandy,</hi> upbraids <hi>Philip</hi> with his perfidiouſneſs, becauſe he had foully broken the Peace he had made with his Brother <hi>Richard:</hi> Yet they went not to Arms, for while they diſcourſe and each defends his right, they agreed on fifty daies ceſſation of Arms, <hi>Baldwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> being againſt it, who therefore forſaking <hi>Philip,</hi> made his Peace with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and takes Counſel by what means, when the Truce was ended they ſhould wage Warre with the <hi>French.</hi> But when <hi>John</hi> was free from the care of Warre, he ſtrikes hand with <hi>Philip</hi> upon unjuſt terms, and <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> hating his ſluggiſhneſs, joyned with the <hi>French</hi> once more, and reſtored the Warre of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> man was glad, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns for his Countrey, yet was very ill received by the Nobility, which hated thoſe baſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. <hi>John</hi> now free from Warre, turns all his care to Pole his ſubjects and to follow his pleaſures. Alſo he deprived his Brother <hi>Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> of all his fortune, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he dehorted him from ſuch injury. Then going into <hi>Normandy,</hi> he Divorced his Wife
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119698:32"/>
                  <hi>Avis,</hi> and married <hi>Iſabell,</hi> Daughter and Heir to the Earl of <hi>Engoleſme.</hi> She was Crown'd at <hi>Canterbury.</hi> But the oppreſſion and violence of King <hi>John</hi> prevailed ſo farre, alſo his baſe luxury, not without murder and man-ſlaughter (for he deſtroyed <hi>Matilda,</hi> a beautifull Maid) cauſing her to drink poyſon, becauſe ſhe would not yield to his intreaty to be corrupted by him, and <hi>William Brauſe</hi> with his Wife for ſpeaking ſomething freely, he killed with famine, taking all their Eſtate from them. But when he asked Subſidy, all the Nobility as one man, denied to follow him forth to Warres, unleſs he would remove the heavy Impoſts, and free them from thoſe curſed injuries. Yet he went afterwards into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and then to <hi>Paris,</hi> with his Wife, where they are to outward appearance friendly received by King <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Marſh,</hi> to whom <hi>Iſabella</hi> the Kings Wife was firſt betrothed, being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with the King for taking his Wife from him, joyned with <hi>Arthur,</hi> and make a new Warre. <hi>Philip</hi> took their part, and ſo joyntly thoſe of <hi>Tours</hi> firſt, then they of <hi>Aniou</hi> invade, and they take the Town <hi>Mirabellum,</hi> with <hi>Eleoner</hi> the Grandmother to <hi>Arthur,</hi> who had fled thither for ſecurity, which was notwithſtanding received by <hi>Arthur</hi> with great piety and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:119698:33"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> reproves King <hi>Philip</hi> for his falſeneſs, and began to think ſeriouſly of revenge, and coming ſuddenly and unlooked for upon the Forces of the Enemy, deſtroyed them with a great ſlaughter, taking thoſe Captive which could not run away, amongſt whom was <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur,</hi> who ſhortly after died in priſon of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, on going to make an eſcape was drowned in the River, or as it is vulgarly thought, he died of grief and ſorrow. His Siſter <hi>Eleoner</hi> died the ſame way ſhortly after.</p>
               <p>All Commotions are not extinguiſhed with <hi>Arthur,</hi> but Warre ſpringing out from Warre, now here, now there ariſe new cauſes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement: For <hi>Conſtance</hi> Mother to <hi>Arthur,</hi> complaining to <hi>Philip</hi> of her Sonne <hi>Arthurs</hi> death, ſhe eaſily inſtigated him to a juſt revenge, who was of his own accord the greateſt enemy to <hi>John.</hi> He preſently ſends his Heralds to <hi>John,</hi> and ſets him a day of hearing to appear before him, as one that ought him Homage: But <hi>John</hi> refuſing, he entred his Territories by Arms, and in ſhort time he ſubdued all <hi>Normandy,</hi> as it were in the face of <hi>John,</hi> who ſtaied ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Roan,</hi> and afterwards doing nothing, he returned into <hi>England,</hi> the Nobility gnaſhing their teeth at it in vain. To this may be added the ſecond and third loſs, for <hi>Eleconer,</hi> the Kings Mother died, who did the Kingdom as much
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119698:33"/>good by her vertues, as the King did miſchief by his vices. <hi>Hubert</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her, who was another Ornament of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>John</hi> ſeemed to be in poſſibility to recover his loſs, ſo his ſubjects would bring Subſidies to help him to wage Warre, which they ſtrove who ſhould do it moſt: So he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth toward <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and ſuddenly ſet ſail, not waiting for the Noblemen that came after him; but he had no ſooner left the ſhore, but he preſently returned, and upbraiding the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility (becauſe they followed him not) with ſluggiſhneſs and diſobedience, he fined them with a vaſt ſumme of money, and ſo being the richer by his double Uſury, neglecting the War, he returned home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> in the mean while, that he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of his Kingdom, takes <hi>Chinon</hi> by force, and he had quickly put an end to the Warre, unleſs <hi>Guido</hi> the Husband of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> falling off from <hi>Philip,</hi> had joyned with <hi>John,</hi> by whoſe help he levied a new Army, whereby he took <hi>Mountalbans,</hi> a Town otherwiſe impregnable, with wonderfull cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in fifteen daies, and after that ſtorming <hi>Aniou</hi> he gave the Plunder to his Souldiers, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Wals of the Town, but he repented it afterwards, and perchance becauſe he was born
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119698:34"/>in that City, he built it again more firm and beautifull than it was. And now <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were in Arms, now on this ſide, now on that, the Army expected the word to fall on, and nothing but blood and ſlaughter was to be expected, but at the Interceſſion of friends, a Ceſſation was granted for two years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> therefore returns for <hi>England,</hi> but upon his return he enters the borders of the <hi>Scotch,</hi> and kils multitudes of them, and brought King <hi>Alexander</hi> to his obedience, and thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> that he found to have revolted, he ſailed with his Fleet thither, and eaſily brought them under; So he made the Rebel <hi>Welſh</hi> upon his return, become Subjects, taking eight and twenty No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-mens children for pledges, which when the <hi>Welſh</hi> roſe again, he commanded to kill them all. So much prevails unadviſed deſire of wrong, though ſometimes it may oppoſe good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to unſatisfied cruelty, and ſo <hi>John</hi> was more cruel and valiant againſt none than to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his own Subjects. He returned afterward into <hi>France,</hi> that (as we ſaid) he might repair the wals of <hi>Aniou,</hi> when thoſe of <hi>Poictou</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted to him. But <hi>Lewis</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Philip</hi> muſtering an Army preſently, not only maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and puniſhed the Rebels, but alſo put all <hi>Johns</hi> Army to flight, and deſtroyed them, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the chief Nobility, by which loſſe, he was
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119698:34"/>brought to deſperation, yet making peace, he returned for <hi>England</hi> to vex his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and to pour forth all his malice on the innocent.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe they could obtain from the King no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of their burdens, conſpiring together, wage warre againſt him. The King when he was too weak, for them, attempted to proceed by ſubtilty, and calling the Nobility together, granted them their requeſts. But afterwards being diſcharged by the Pope from his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he takes up armes againſt them, and ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt all <hi>England,</hi> he threw down the Caſtles and Forts of all the Conſpirators every where. There was a Bull ſent from the Pope againſt all the Nobility that diſobeyed his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. The Nobility being too weak for the King in Arms, they commit an unjuſt and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous wickedneſſe, calling in the ſonne of the <hi>French</hi> King to their aſſiſtance, and promiſing obedience to him, as to their King: He ſtayed not, but ſailed for <hi>England</hi> with a Navy of ſix hundred ſhips. The conſpired Nobility joyn'd with him, and ſo joyning their forces they came for <hi>London,</hi> where <hi>Lewis</hi> with a fair ſpeech wone the Citizens to his ſide. Alſo the <hi>Scotch</hi> entred <hi>England</hi> with a mighty Army, deſtroying all things in the way, whereby <hi>Lewis,</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:119698:35"/>as alſo by the other Forces being ſtrengthned, overruns all <hi>England</hi> with eaſe. <hi>John</hi> in the mean time, leaſt he ſhould ſeem to do nothing, gathering together a great many vagabonds, ſpoils miſerably the Lands of his Subjects, at laſt in the paſſing of ſome Rivers, not a few of his followers being drown'd, and being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weakned for want of help, falling thereby into grief of minde, and ſo into a Feaver, he died within a few dayes.</p>
               <p>Great controverſies aroſe between the King and the Pope during his Raign in Church-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, about the choice of ſome Biſhops: The Pope got the upper-hand, and made the King do him homage, after that the buſineſſe of the Church had ſtood ſtill ſix years, and three moneths.</p>
               <p>He was immoderate in blaſphemies and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations; Alſo he is thought to have ſought aid from <hi>Mirammula</hi> King of <hi>Africa,</hi> whileſt he was in his troubles, promiſing to him the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England,</hi> if he conquer'd, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Chriſtian Faith. He was ſad and dark of countenance, he was tall and fat, ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh and idle of Nature, he ſeldome conquered the enemy, but by force, being inconſtant, in adverſe fortune he was eaſily dejected. He was falſe in his promiſes, burdenſom to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, troubleſom to his neighbours, and hated of all.</p>

               <p>AFter <hi>Johns</hi> deceaſe his firſt born ſonne <hi>Henry,</hi> not yet paſſed nine years old, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Kingdom, not without ſome contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie of the Nobles: Some of the Nobility fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off to him, who a little before had made a defection, and ſwear to King <hi>Lewis,</hi> yet <hi>Lewis</hi> with thoſe that followed him from <hi>London,</hi> with an Army of twenty thouſand men, wone many Towns, till at laſt he came to the Caſtle at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> which a certain noble woman did manly defend, and cauſed him to ſtop, and an Army of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> coming on in the mean time, he was repulſed and conquered. Many of the Engliſh Nobility being taken that ſtood with him, beſides the Count of <hi>Perch,</hi> who preferred an honourable death before a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable life, yet he did not deſpair, but ſent for new forces out of <hi>France,</hi> which were all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſtroyed in a fight at Sea. By theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes he was forced to take Conditions, whereby there were granted to King <hi>Lewis</hi> in reſpect of his charge he had been at, a hundred and five thouſand franks, he renouncing all
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119698:36"/>Right to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing faithfully to prevail with his Father to reſtore all the Provinces in <hi>France</hi> that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But the King reſtored to the Rebel Nobility all the Lands that belonged unto them, and ſo <hi>Lewis</hi> leaving <hi>England</hi> ſet ſail at <hi>Dover</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> having waged war unhappily in anothers Land.</p>
               <p>The union and reſt of the Kingdome being thus eſtabliſhed for a time, ſuddenly there aroſe a new faction of the Conſpirators. It was known to all what the intention was, but what hopes they had was unknown to none, becauſe it was fortified but with ſmall forces, and was unproſperouſly ſuppreſſed, thoſe being puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that refuſed to ſubmit. At laſt all care is converted to the recovering of thoſe Provinces in <hi>France,</hi> that belonged to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> large Tributes and Impoſts being granted to the King. For though the <hi>French</hi> had promiſed reſtitution of them, yet he would not yeeld them up, but by force of arms, yet it was deferred untill the King being of riper years, ſhould ſtand upon his own Right, and ſhould governe the whole matter himſelf. In the mean while, thoſe fields that were fenced in for Parks by his Anceſtors, he laid them open, and reſtored them for huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, and to the common good. But when he was grown up, he recalled again thoſe grants,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119698:36"/>and what he gratified the people with in his minority, he revoked, turning thoſe fields for his pleaſure into Parks again. And not content with this injury, he alienated the hearts of his Subjects from him by many more unlawfull acts. He aboliſhed the old Seal, and made a new one, and ſo extorted a great ſumme of money from his Subjects; Alſo he greatly drained them under a pretence of a warre with <hi>France,</hi> and managing the matter ſlothfully, he returned without a victory, bringing with him out of <hi>France</hi> many of <hi>Poictou,</hi> that what reward they had not deſired in <hi>France,</hi> he might pay them in <hi>England,</hi> whereby the beſt men were diſcharged of their Offices, and theſe vagabonds and ſtrangers were poſſeſſed of them. The King being now of ripe years took to wife <hi>Eleonor</hi> the daughter of <hi>Raymound</hi> Earl of <hi>Province,</hi> whereby there grew no profit to his affairs, but rather by reaſon of a thredbare and beggarly Family, and her Kindred coming from all parts, as Crows to the prey, he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great detriment, which yet were highly eſteemed by him, the people much murmuring at it.</p>
               <p>But whilſt the King thus goes about to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his Subjects Rights, which they labour to preſerve, all the Nobility being offended at the promotion of ſtrangers, they enter into a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119698:37"/>conſpiracy; The Ringleader whereof was <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Marſhall,</hi> who durſt freely tell the King of his injuſtice, and required ſatisfaction. But the King to puniſh their arrogancy, muſter'd a great Army of ſtrangers, and withall cals a Parliament, which is an Aſſembly of ſeveral Orders. The Nobility refuſe to be preſent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he would command the Biſhop of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Peter de Rupibus</hi> of <hi>Poictou,</hi> and all his gang to forſake the Court, threatning withall, that unleſſe ſatisfaction were made unto them, they would depoſe the King, and all ſtrangers that were his Adherents, and would chooſe another King, the King therefore commands all that were upon Knights ſervice, and the Nobility to be preſent to fight for him, which they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to do, whereupon he confiſcated all their goods, and diſtributed them amongſt thoſe of <hi>Poictou,</hi> and their perſons to be baniſhed, whereſoever they could be found. By which threats they being frighted or corrupted by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the chief of them fall off, whereby the reſt were weakned, and flie into <hi>Wales,</hi> to the Prince of that Countrey <hi>Lionel,</hi> drawn to hold part with them, to whom <hi>Hugh Burgies</hi> came, eſcaping out of a Caſtle where he was unjuſtly impriſoned. The King follows thoſe fugitives into <hi>Wales,</hi> but came back with diſgrace doing nothing. But <hi>Richard Marſhall</hi> when he would
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119698:37"/>not return into the Kings favour, being drawn cunningly into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to look to his Eſtate, and there being accuſed of Treaſon, was killed, though the King ſtrove to remove the envy of that deed from himſelf.</p>
               <p>A Parliament being called, ſome men that had care of the Commonwealth, were thoſe that perſwaded the King to leave off war, and to make Peace with his Nobility, the King hearkned to their councel, and recalling the Nobles out of <hi>Wales,</hi> he treats with them, whereby they are reſtored to their former dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and ſtrangers that poſſeſſed their places, were removed from all places, and a great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty laid upon them, yet ſome of them (as Fortune is inconſtant) were re-admitted into the Kings favour.</p>
               <p>The King then feigning that all favour was for his own Subjects, extorted a great Summe of money from them; which yet he diſtributed amongſt the poor kindred of the Queen, and her Father a poor Prince: And having promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before to exclude all ſtrangers from favour, (and alwayes to take counſell of his Subjects) he began now to eſteem them more; with which indignity the Nobility offended, enter upon a new conſpiracy, to which, as the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Chief, <hi>Richard</hi> the Kings brother had given his Name, who being ſo bold as to tell
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119698:38"/>the King of his faults to his teeth, doth forcibly dehort him from ſuch fallacies. The King was much incenſed with this, and ſeeing the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Londoners</hi> toward the Conſpiratours, calling a Parliament, and publiſhing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, he treats with them for Peace. But before it was come ſo far, the Earl of <hi>Cornwall</hi> the Kings brother was drawn off to the contrary part, whereby the Nobility urged their matters more faintly, and ſo the Treaty could come to no concluſion. The King now free from all impediments, tyrannizeth more over the Nobles, the chief of the Conſpiratours were baniſhed, or turned out of their places. Nor did he leſſe oppreſſe the Clergy, putting ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into Church-Offices, at the Popes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, diſpoſſeſſing the Nations, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heavy Taxes upon them, ſo that all hated him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> purpoſing to make a new expedition for <hi>France,</hi> asks Subſidies from his Parliament, which being denied, he was forced to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row otherwhere; Nor yet did he ſpend it ſucceſſefully, after a years delay, and having done nothing well, concluding a diſgracefull peace with the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But returning for <hi>England,</hi> he tyrannized over the Jews, and wreſted a great Summe of money from them, which he yet conſumed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119698:38"/>with unſeaſonable gifts very indiſcreetly; And ſo his Exchequer being conſumed, and Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies denied him from the Parliament, gave him occaſion of new oppreſſions, and ſo drawing the means of the Church to himſelf, was a cauſe of great differences between him and the Pope. But the King being inconſtant laid down the Bucklers, and yeelded to the Pope, who recovering his goods in <hi>England,</hi> did againe pole the poor people of the Kingdome with continual ſucking.</p>
               <p>To this may be added, that there was a daily conflux out of <hi>France,</hi> and other parts into <hi>England</hi> of this new Family, having ſome relation to the King, this or that way, whoſe wants muſt be magnificently ſupplied to the great detriment of the Commonwealth. The King grew ſtill poorer by it, and ſo applied himſelf to rapines and extortions, and ſold ſuch furniture as belonged to the Crowne, wreſting all the moneys he could to pay thoſe he ſtood indebted to.</p>
               <p>Then when he could no longer do it by ſuch inconvenient wayes, he obtained a ſmall Summe of money from the <hi>Londoners,</hi> by threats and violence. And then turning to the Nobility, he asked a Subſidy of them in vain, and he found his Church-men as backward, with whom he could do little or nothing.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:119698:39"/>
               <p>Then enterprizing an Expedition to the holy Land to free the King of <hi>France,</hi> he called an Aſſembly of his Biſhops and Peers, from whom when he could not obtain one mite of money, being like a mad man, he drove them all out of the Chamber; The Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> for that inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was excepted againſt by him. At laſt ſome help was afforded him, whereupon he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confirm ſolemnly <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> but that money which he had appointed for the holy Warre was quickly waſted, partly by gifts, partly by banquetting, and other frauds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented for his own deſtruction. Alſo he had upon a vain hope redeemed the Kingdomes of <hi>Sicily</hi> for his ſon <hi>Edmund,</hi> paying a great ſumme of money to the Pope.</p>
               <p>In the interim, the <hi>Welſh</hi> vexed with great injuries, fall away from the Prince, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe theſe, and reduce them to obedience, he ſtood in need of a new ſupply of money, which at laſt by neat devices and inventions he wrung from them.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwall</hi> the Kings brother, at the ſuit of the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> is choſen King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but ſhortly when he grew inſolent with importunate oppreſſions and revenges, he was put out of the place, and returned for <hi>England</hi> a poor Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who went out a rich Earl.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:119698:39"/>
               <p>But <hi>Henry</hi> that he might make up that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which the Pope had wiped him of, by a vain boaſt of the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily,</hi> he asks once more a Subſidy from his Nobles, who refuſing ſtifly, and the King preſſing for it, they fall to odds, afterwards calling a new Parliament, which the Lords had procured for the ſafety of the Kingdom, he was compelled by Oath, and his Son alſo to confirm it. At which time it was Enacted that the Kings Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the men of <hi>Poictiers</hi> that remained in <hi>England</hi> ſhould preſently depart the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But a contagious peſtilence ariſing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturally, or by ſome venom theſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſcattered when they departed. Many of the Nobility died, whereupon many were put to death out of bare ſuſpicion, ſome are caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſon, and ſome are baniſhed. Nor did leſs evils for this afflict the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for they that had the charge of correcting the errors of others, did with all cruelty weed up the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that now ſo many Lords as there were, ſo many Tyrants there were, and the ſervants were grown like their Maſters. And that they might ſtirre up the envy of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects againſt the King, they caſt all the fault upon him, which he endeavoured to free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from by his publick Writ, but all in vain, when he was compelled in a ſolemn Parliament
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119698:40"/>to give that power he had given to twenty four choſen men before, to the Earls <hi>Montfort,</hi> and of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and to <hi>Spencer,</hi> taking an Oath to confirm it unto them.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, <hi>Richard</hi> King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> being landed in <hi>England, Henry</hi> growing bolder by the return of his Brother, though he were poor, firſt demands a diſcharge of his Oath from the Pope; then he oppoſed himſelf againſt the inſolency of the Nobility: He flies to help from the <hi>French</hi> King, who is choſen Umpire between <hi>Henry</hi> and his Nobles, to end the controverſie, but when he did nothing they break forth on all ſides into open Warre. The Count of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> drives forth the Earl of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> and ſtorms his Caſtle, and laid a great fine upon the Citizens. Then he took the Fort at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and afterwards the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Windſor.</hi> But the King fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leaſt he ſhould come ſo farre as <hi>London,</hi> thought it concerned him to make peace with him. They agreed at laſt on theſe conditions, That all the Caſtles ſhould be delivered up to the Lords, and all ſtrangers at a day appointed, ſhould forthwith depart the Kingdom, only thoſe excepted who had a Licence given them to ſtay.</p>
               <p>But the King calling a new Parliament, he drew ſome of the Nobility, eſpecially his own
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119698:40"/>ſonnes to his party, to whom <hi>John Comminus, Bayly, Robert Bruſe,</hi> and others from <hi>Scotland</hi> joyn'd themſelves: with theſe being not a little confirmed, he denounceth Warre againſt the Earls of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who did not at all excuſe themſelves: who ſeeing the King daily increaſe in Forces, levying a ſudden but farre leſs Army, oppoſe the King; and here fraud ſupplied the parts of vertue, for ſetting their Banners behinde without Souldiers, they made a ſhew of a greater Army than they had. And fortune helped a good cauſe, for the Kings Forces being diſperſed, the greateſt part of them was oppreſſed and ſlain, the reſt ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by flight: But the King, the Prince and Earl of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and his Sonne <hi>Henry,</hi> and all the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nobility fell into the enemies hands.</p>
               <p>There had been an end of the King and his fortune, leaſt a contention ariſing between the Earls of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> had given cauſe to a hot conteſt, and afterwards to a ſharp Warre, where <hi>Leicester</hi> being too weak, yet fell valiantly with wonderfull glory.</p>
               <p>By the ſame fortune, <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Guide Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,</hi> the Sonnes of the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> were baniſhed one into <hi>Italy,</hi> the other into <hi>France,</hi> where afterwards they gave their name to moſt illuſtrious families. Alſo their Mother a gallant
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119698:41"/>woman, being gone a little before into <hi>France,</hi> ended her life in a Nunnery.</p>
               <p>A new contention being riſen amongſt the Nobles, they ſound the Trumpet to Battell again; alſo the <hi>Welſh</hi> who had helped Earl <hi>Monifort,</hi> are remanded to be ſlain. But peace being confirmed on all ſides, this trouble aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without blood.</p>
               <p>Reſt now obtained at home, <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> at the requeſt of the <hi>French</hi> King, goes forth toward the Warre in <hi>Paleſtina:</hi> but <hi>Richard</hi> once King of the <hi>Romans</hi> died in the mean time, whom <hi>Henry</hi> himſelf followed ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, whilſt he ſtudied to repair the loſſes he ſuſtained by Warre.</p>

               <p>WHen <hi>Henry</hi> died, <hi>Edward</hi> ſtaied in <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> being intent about the holy Warre, where he underwent a grievous dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, having received three wounds from his adverſary with a poiſoned weapon. But he was cured by the wonderfull piety of his wife, who with her mouth in time ſucked out the venom
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119698:41"/>from the wounds. In his way, being made more certain of his Fathers death, he came at laſt over-land into his Country, and was inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurated King.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of his Reign he uſed the Nobility well; but he to abate the inſolence of the Clergy, commanded their wealth to be brought into his Exchequer, and he afflicted them by other means, and ſo drew upon him their envy. The <hi>Welſh,</hi> whoſe cuſtom it was on all occaſions to make new Commotions, now afreſh under their Leader <hi>Lionel,</hi> riſe up againſt <hi>Edward,</hi> and rage with wonderfull pride, but this tempeſt ſoon vaniſhed, for <hi>Eleoner</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Simon Monifort</hi> eſpouſed to <hi>Lionel,</hi> whilſt ſhe came out of <hi>France</hi> by Sea to her Husband, was taken in the way, whom he was forced to redeem at a great ranſom, promiſing alſo to <hi>Edward</hi> continual Homage, and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Brother <hi>David</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who was highly eſteemed by <hi>Edward.</hi> But <hi>Lionels</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience laſted not above three years, for his Wife <hi>Eleoner</hi> being dead, he breaks forth into new rebellions. Alſo <hi>David</hi> forgetting the great love of King <hi>Edward</hi> to him, fell off preſently to his Brother, and ſo with joynt Forces they enter <hi>England,</hi> and did ſome miſchief to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> both wonderfully inflamed by a falſe Propheſie of <hi>Merlin,</hi> whereby the Crown of

                  <hi>Brutus</hi> was promiſed to <hi>Lionel;</hi> But the Battell being ſet, <hi>Lionel</hi> was killed by a private Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and his Head was brought to the King, who cauſed it to be faſtned on a pole, and to be Crowned with joy, and ſet up on the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> The lot of <hi>David</hi> was like to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who being taken in <hi>Wales,</hi> was drawn with a Horſe to the place of execution, and there beheaded, and his Head ſet by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and his four quarters were ſent to the four principall Cities of <hi>England.</hi> So <hi>Edward</hi> revenged the Rebellion of the <hi>Welſh,</hi> and the death of <hi>Alphonſus</hi> his firſt born, who was killed in the ſame Battell.</p>
               <p>But a greater cloud hung over his head from <hi>Scotland.</hi> For <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whilſt he rode the Great Horſe, fell with him, and ſo died, leaving his Daughter <hi>Margaret</hi> to inherit; but ſhe, ſhortly after her Father, died alſo, leaving the Kingdom to ten Corrivals who ſtrove for it. <hi>Edward</hi> was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Umpire by them all to ſearch their Titles: but he reduced all their pretences to two eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, namely <hi>John Bayly</hi> and <hi>Robert Bruſe,</hi> who with equal right affected the Kingdom; whilſt the matter ſticks between them, <hi>Edward</hi> ſets on <hi>Bruſe,</hi> promiſing to him the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> for ever, ſo he would do him Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage for it: But <hi>Bruſe</hi> refuſed it, preferring
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119698:42"/>his Countries Liberty before his own Honour; but <hi>Baily</hi> yielded to thoſe conditions, and ſo gained the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the ill will of all his Country men. Envy againſt him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed for refuſing juſtice upon the death of the Earl of <hi>Fife,</hi> who was ſlain, for <hi>Baily</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted <hi>Albermeth</hi> that ſlew him from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereupon <hi>Baily</hi> was cited to appear before <hi>Edwards</hi> Tribunal, was forced to plead his cauſe. He was angry for this diſgrace, and returns to his Kingdom, and afterwards denied Homage to <hi>Edward,</hi> and proclaimed Warre, making a Covenant with the <hi>French</hi> King. Hence aroſe the cauſe of a moſt bloody Warre between the two Nations, which laſted for 300 years, only ſome feigned ceſſations paſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween.</p>
               <p>Armies are Muſtered on both ſides, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> giving the firſt onſet on the <hi>Scotch,</hi> ſlew abundance of them, and won many Cities and Caſtles; by which loſs <hi>Bruſius</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to beg for Peace, which was granted, but he himſelf was carried Captive into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and being afterwards ſet at liberty, he ended his daies in <hi>France,</hi> expecting in vain the reſtitution of his goods. And ſo <hi>Edward</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned for <hi>England,</hi> leaving after him <hi>John Varamius</hi> Earl of <hi>Suſſex</hi> his Embaſſador, and <hi>Hugh Chryſingamius</hi> his Treaſurer, to take
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119698:43"/>care of the <hi>Scotch</hi> buſineſs. But a little after this, the <hi>Scotch,</hi> when the King was gone into <hi>France,</hi> making head againſt the Kings Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, having <hi>William Valla</hi> for their Captain, they killed <hi>Hugh Chryſingamius,</hi> and with him 6000 <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But the King came back for <hi>England,</hi> commanded that his Court ſhould be held at <hi>York;</hi> and preſently levying an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he aſſaulted the <hi>Scotch</hi> afreſh at <hi>Fonkirk,</hi> and though he himſelf were diſmounted from his Horſe, that was frighted with the hollow of the enemy, and was dangerouſly wounded, two ribs being broken in his body, yet he made a great ſlaughter amongſt them, 40000 Horſe and Foot of them being ſlain: Only <hi>Vallas</hi> with a ſmall handfull of men eſcaped by flight from the fury of the enemy. All the Noble mens goods are made forfeit to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and they were all made Tributaries, and to ſwear the third time to be true to King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the falſe <hi>Scot</hi> kept his word but a very ſhort time, for <hi>Bruſius</hi> the Son of <hi>Robert</hi> being made King in a Turbulent manner, new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions ariſe, for he fearing the power of <hi>John Cuminus,</hi> cauſed him wickedly to be murdered in the Temple of <hi>Dumfriſe.</hi> When <hi>Edward</hi> heard this, he was wonderfully incenſed: Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently having raiſed a gallant Army he marcheth
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119698:43"/>into <hi>Scotland,</hi> not meaning to ceaſe, till he had brought down the uſurper of that Kingdom. The Earl of <hi>Pembreke,</hi> who was marched before with his Brigade, lighting ſuddenly on <hi>Bruſe,</hi> deſtroyed all his men, from whoſe hands the King himſelf hardly eſcaped, he led a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable llfe in Caves, Dens, and Crags of Mountains, ſeeking his fortune in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. His Brothers falling into the power of the enemy, were put to extream tortures as Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
               <p>The King fierce with the madneſs of Revenge, ſpared no mans life, but ſlew all he met withall. The Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> alſo, though he were of the Kings blood, was ſent to <hi>London</hi> and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there: ſo and by ſuch like waies were the followers of <hi>Bruſe</hi> puniſhed. Yet <hi>Bruſe,</hi> though he wanted almoſt any to follow him, did not give out, but collecting a handfull of ſouldiers, he ſets upon the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> ſuddenly, and put him to the worſt with great loſs and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and he drove the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> into the Caſtle of <hi>Ayrs,</hi> and beſieged him there, untill <hi>Edward</hi> coming to his relief, he was forced to fly to his old ſculking holes.</p>
               <p>In the mean time a new Warre breaks forth with the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi> the Fair, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between the ſubjects of either King, and ariſing from pretended injury; for Kings
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119698:44"/>that envy one the other do eaſily break into open hatred. The King of <hi>England</hi> alſo was juſtly angry, and ſought all occaſions of wrong greedily, by reaſon that <hi>Henry</hi> his Couſin, Son to <hi>Richard</hi> the Emperour, was killed by the Earl <hi>Montfrots</hi> Son, at which wickedneſs the <hi>French</hi> connived. In a fight at Sea firſt a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction was brought upon the <hi>French</hi> at the entrance of the River <hi>Sion</hi> and elſewhere. And <hi>Edward</hi> when a day was appointed for him as a ſtipendiary to plead his cauſe before King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> he refuſed to appear, and the Homage he did willingly before, he now refuſed to do: whereupon a great Army being raiſed, <hi>Philip</hi> enters upon the Territories of <hi>Edward</hi> in <hi>France</hi> by force of Arms. The King of <hi>England,</hi> by the aſſiſtance of neighbour Princes, the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and others, to which was joyned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119698:45"/>Fathers order, and in his laſt words forbad him not to recall him, who afterwards gave cauſe of great diſſentions; for when the King beſtowed, immoderate gifts upon him, he made the Nobility envious againſt him, and himſelf poor. But his Father being yet not interred, he endeavoured to conclude the Matrimony with King <hi>Philip</hi>'s Daughter, that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted when King <hi>Edward</hi> lived, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with great preparation of the Nobles, and eſpecially of <hi>Gaveſtone,</hi> four Kings being preſent, and three Queens except the Bride. The Dowry was the Dukedom of <hi>Aquitan,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> King had poſſeſſed himſelf of. But he being returned into <hi>England,</hi> the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were offended by reaſon of the too great power of <hi>Gaveſtone,</hi> they deny the ſolemnity of the Coronation, unleſs he would baniſh this inſolent odious man from his Court and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The King ſeemed to hearken to it, and ſo is inaugurated with his Queen in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by the conſent of all. But whenas he ſhould baniſh <hi>Gaveſtone,</hi> he highly promoted him, the Nobility not a little murmuring at it.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the chief power was in <hi>Gaveſtone,</hi> the Nobles had no authority; and that he might precede the reſt in glory, a Tilting was appointed, where he obtained the greateſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119698:45"/>praiſe. His valour was worthy of reward, but that the inſolent man turned all to the contempt of the Nobility. In the mean while a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was called, wherein, amongſt the reſt, it was Enacted, That the Decrees of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> ſhould be obſerved; Strangers ſhould be put out of their Offices, and that all things ſhould be done in a ſolemn ſitting of the Senate, nor ſhould the King go out of the Land, the Parliament being ignorant of it or againſt it, nor ſhould make Warre againſt any, and that <hi>Gaveſtone</hi> ſhould be baniſhed.</p>
               <p>Whereupon he is ſent away for <hi>Ireland,</hi> not as a baniſhed man, but as Preſident of the Iſland, where alſo behaving himſelf well he had deſerved commendation and reward. But the King by prepoſterous counſell, a contract being made for him with the ſiſter of the Earl of <hi>Glociſter,</hi> being impatient of his abſence, called him back from his baniſhment, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſettled him in his former grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. But he to give the King thanks, by cunning flattery, ſucked the King of all he had, that he left him ſcarce ſufficient for his neceſſity. The Nobles in the mean while hating his inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, threaten a generall revolt from the King, unleſs he would ſend away his proud ſubject. But <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> when he had wandred ſome time in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> returns privately into
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119698:46"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> being generally hated, being the more confident by reaſon of the Kings and his Father in Law the Earl of <hi>Gleceſters</hi> favour. The King received him moſt friendly, and that his arrivall might be concealed from the Nobles, the King takes a journey with him toward <hi>York.</hi> The Nobility that had knowledge of it enter a Conſpiracy, to which all ſubſcribed but the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter:</hi> And they make <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> the head of the faction; and ſo they laid a neceſſity on the King, either to deliver up <hi>Gaveſton</hi> into the hands of the Lords, or elſe to ſend him out of the Land. But <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> being blinde with fooliſh favour, would not hearken to the Lords, but ſhut him up in a ſtrong Caſtle, that ſo he might eſcape the envy of the Nobility.

Three things were left in charge to <hi>Edward</hi> by his dying Father, and were commanded in his Will, namely, That he ſhould carry his Fathers bones along with him, till he had conquered <hi>Scotland:</hi> That he ſhould expend 30000<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> upon the holy Warre: And that he ſhould not recall <hi>Gaveſton.</hi> He obeyed not the two later, for that money decreed for the Holy Warre he beſtowed on <hi>Gaveſton</hi> when he was come back, for the third we ſhall ſee
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119698:46"/>what he did. The King of <hi>Scots Bruſius,</hi> who had long ſince intelligence of King <hi>Edwards</hi> ſlothfulneſs, would not paſs over ſuch an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of well managing his buſineſs, levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Army, preſently reduced all <hi>Scotland</hi> into his power. And not therewith content, he enters the borders of <hi>England</hi> and deſtroys all by fire and ſword. <hi>Edward</hi> to repulſe force by force, raiſed an Army of an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souldiers, better fitted with furniture than valour, which was eaſily vanquiſhed by the <hi>Scotch,</hi> that were ſcarce 30000, joyning craft and valour together. The chief of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in this fight were either ſlain or taken Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. The Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> himſelf, when he had given ſufficient tokens of his fortitude, fighting valiantly in the head of the Army, was killed, the reſt ſaved themſelves by flight. This made the hearts of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to fail, and a great part of the Nobles and Commons revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Conquerours, by a fearfull example of perjury puniſhed. <hi>Bruſe</hi> following his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, enters upon <hi>Ireland</hi> with an Army, a great part of it he over-runne, and depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it very farre: Alſo he was ſaluted King of the ſame Iſland, the inhabitants falling to him abundantly. And he ruled three years, untill the Primate of <hi>Armath,</hi> and <hi>Berningam</hi> the chief Judge in <hi>Ireland,</hi> raiſing a great Army,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119698:47"/>ſet upon the Conquerour, and take him with a great ſlaughter of his men, and cut off his Head. The <hi>Scots</hi> almoſt mad with the death of their King, waſte the Borders of <hi>England</hi> ſo farre as <hi>York</hi> with ſword and fire. To mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their Inſolence, a great Army was raiſed of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who marched toward <hi>York.</hi> But diſcord growing between the Commanders, before they ſaw the Enemy, they either ſlipt away, or returned home. Then <hi>Barwick</hi> by the Treaſon of <hi>Peter Spalding</hi> was delivered up to the Enemies hands, which <hi>Edward</hi> preſently laid ſiege to. But the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> falling away with his men, by reaſon of a quarrel, the <hi>Scotch</hi> in the mean time making havock of all, and conquering divers Cities and Caſtles, he was forward to retreat. To this it fell out that the <hi>Yorkshire</hi> men raiſing a great power of the common people, and ſetting upon the <hi>Scots,</hi> were unhappily beaten and killed by them. The King removing his ſiege from <hi>Barwick,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the <hi>Scots</hi> that were laden with the prey and the ſpoil, but he was fruſtrated of his end, they having marched another way. The next year entring <hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe the Enemy had waſted all before his coming, by reaſon of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and want, was compelled to return back again. But the <hi>Scotch</hi> following him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuddenly upon him, he ſuffered a great
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119698:47"/>loſſe, and hardly eſcaped himſelf, and ſo find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf too weak for the Enemy, he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a Truce for two years. But he was vexed with farre greater troubles than theſe at home; For <hi>Gaveſton</hi> being dead, the younger <hi>Spencer</hi> ſucceeded in the Kings Grace and Favour, who after he had obtained the Government of the Commonwealth in as high a manner as <hi>Gave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> had, he could not chooſe but fall under the ſame malice of the Nobility. But the cover of this envy was too unjuſt that it could be hid by a publick conteſt, ſome other occaſion muſt be ſought for. They all with one conſent ask of the King, that he would keep entire the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions formerly granted, threatning him with a revolt, and ſo they raiſe great Forces for War, but the Prelates interpoſing, they made Peace on both parts.</p>
               <p>But ſhortly after a Parliament being called, the King complains openly of the wrong they had done him, and of <hi>Gaveſtons</hi> death; But the Nobility ſay they had committed no ſinne in ſo doing, but growing remorſe by the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Queen, and the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> they ask pardon of the King upon their knees; They eaſily obtain'd it, which was granted to them under the Kings Broad-Seal.</p>
               <p>Now all the diſſention ſeemed to be laid aſleep, but as fire raked up in aſhes, is kindled
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119698:48"/>by any little winde, ſometimes into a great flame, ſo there needed but a ſmall blaſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the former troubles. The firſt occaſion of defection was given, becauſe the wife of the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> with which he had a long time lived quietly, was taken from him with the Counties of <hi>Lincoln</hi> and <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> by <hi>Richard Sanmartin</hi> a very deformed man, who ſaid he had conjugal cuſtom with her before, which thing ſhe openly confeſſed when ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded concerning it. Another occaſion was given, when at <hi>Whitſontide</hi> a certain woman riding ridiculouſly on horsback in fools habit, did go into the Court and upbraid the King with his ingratitude toward his faithfull Miniſters. A third, when a certain Knight that had a packet of the Kings was intercepted, wherein was written a deſire to the King of <hi>Scots</hi> to cut off the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> whereupon not a few fell from the King to that Earl. A fourth, when a certain mad man <hi>John Poudras</hi> counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting himſelf to be King <hi>Edward,</hi> and feared not to ſay, that <hi>Edward</hi> they miſtook for their King was falſly ſuppoſed to be ſo, which mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he paid dearly for by the torture he was put to. But the greateſt of all was, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Baron, <hi>William Breviſius,</hi> who had ſpent the greateſt part of his Eſtate in riot and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, would needs ſell the reſt by Port-ſale,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119698:48"/>which <hi>Humphrey Bobun</hi> gaping after, asking leave of the King, did tranſact with <hi>William.</hi> for them. Alſo both the <hi>Roger Mortimers</hi> being ignorant of other Competitours, cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Bargain, and <hi>Spencer</hi> had obtained immediate leave from the King to buy them, and was preferred before any other. It is a wonder what hatred he drew upon himſelf by this matter. Now all the Nobility came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and entred a conſpiracy, crying out, that the <hi>Spencers</hi> both Father and Sonne were Traitors, Corrupters of the King, and Plagues to the Commonwealth, and at laſt they fell to their Arms. They come in haſte to <hi>London</hi> with their Army, and with leave granted, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the City, and make their complaints to the King, which he yeelded to by the Interceſſion of many. Laſtly, The <hi>Spencers</hi> were baniſhed, but ſhortly after, when the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> contended in a Common-Councel of a <hi>London</hi> Senate, that that baniſhment was unjuſt, the <hi>Spencers</hi> are called home again, the King being no wayes unwilling to it. This drove the Nobility on, but another miſchief moved the King. For the Queen taking her Progreſſe toward <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whenas ſhe would have diverted towards the Lord of <hi>Baldeſmire,</hi> ſhe was diſhonourably ſhut out, and was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to turn away to ſome other place. Of which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119698:49"/>matter ſhe complained to the King, and it made him extream angry, who now doth think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but revenge for that injury, collecting ſuddenly a Band of Souldiers, he aſſaulted that Caſtle, which when he had overcome, the Governour of it <hi>Thomas Culpeper,</hi> was hanged, and <hi>Baldeſmire</hi> with his wife and children was caſt into Priſon, and all his goods Confiſcate. And the Kings Blood being now hot, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded farther, and reſolved to make Warre upon the Nobles, but they finding that his Army increaſed, part returned to their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and part fell to their Arms; But their Army being either ſlipt away or vanquiſhed, ſome were killed in the fight, the reſt were taken, amongſt whom was the Earl of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> who was beheaded before his own Caſtle, the reſt were either hanged or beheaded, that <hi>England</hi> was never more ſorrowfully wet with Noble Blood.</p>
               <p>Now the laſt and worſt miſchief of all hanged over his head, for the King of <hi>France</hi> for the Poſſeſſions that <hi>Edward</hi> had in <hi>France,</hi> required Homage from him for them, but <hi>Edward</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, he enter'd his Provinces with an Army. At length Queen <hi>Iſabella, Edwards</hi> wife was ſent to intreat him not to waſte his Countrey: ſhe went willingly, partly to performe the Kings Commands, partly to complain to her
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119698:49"/>Brother. For <hi>Edward</hi> by the Inſtigation of <hi>Spencer</hi> was no little eſtranged from her, and had offended her with great contempt. <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> went with her, with whom the Queen held unlawfull Familiarity, which when the King underſtood, he ſent to the <hi>French</hi> King ſome that ſhould deſire him to ſend home the Queen with the Prince her Sonne. But ſhe not returning is baniſhed out of all the Kings Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions and Gariſons made to drive her off, if ſhe came againſt the Kings Will. But ſhe flying to the Earl of <hi>Hannonia,</hi> Matrimony being contracted between Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> and the Earls Sonne, ſhe procured a good Army from him, <hi>John</hi> the Earls Brother being Generall; Setting ſail they land about <hi>Harwich,</hi> to whom immediately <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and other Nobles joyned themſelves. The King receiving news of it, was wonderfully frighted, he left <hi>London</hi> without ſtay, the City being addicted to the Queen, and purpoſing to flie into <hi>Lundy</hi> Iſland, by a Tempeſt he was driven into <hi>Wales.</hi> In the mean while the <hi>Londoners,</hi> that they might ſhew their loves to the Queen, cut off the Heads of <hi>Gualter Stapleton</hi> Treaſurer of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> moſt cruelly, becauſe he was addicted to the King, and ſome others alſo. Nor did the Queen do leſſe at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> killing <hi>Hugh</hi> Father to <hi>Spencer,</hi> who was ninety years old, cauſing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119698:50"/>him to be dragged to Execution, pulling his heart out alive. Then ſhe ſent part of her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to finde out the King, <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter</hi> being the chief, and <hi>Rice Paulinus</hi> a <hi>Welſhman,</hi> who becauſe he knew every paſſage of the Countrey exactly, he lead the Earl to the Monaſtery of <hi>Neth,</hi> where the King hid himſelf, where preſently both he, with <hi>Spencer, Robert Baldoch,</hi> and <hi>Simon Redyng,</hi> is delivered into the hands of his Enemies, and is left to the Cuſtody of the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him with all reſpect, as it was fit a captive King ſhould be. But <hi>Edmund</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel, John Daniel</hi> and <hi>Thomas Micheldem,</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed at the requeſt of <hi>Mortimer.</hi> But <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> who was now Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> is now with <hi>Simon Redyng</hi> drawn to Execution, and being firſt hanged, they were afterwards beheaded and quartered, and their Heads ſet up on <hi>London</hi> Bridge, the quarters were ſent to the chief Cities, but <hi>Baldoch</hi> was famiſhed to death in priſon. Then a Parliament is called, wherein they conſulted to depoſe the King, and to Crown the Prince his Sonne <hi>Edward.</hi> But he being farre more Religious than his Mother, would not accept the Crown, unleſſe his Father would reſign it willingly. Some are ſent to perſwade this miſerable King, and the unhappy man did yeeld eaſily to it. A day is ſet for the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119698:50"/>delivering up his Title, and <hi>Edward</hi> cloathed in black, comes into the Chamber, where they were gathered together that ſhould receive his Abdication, but he ſcarce ſaw the proviſion made for his renunciation, but he ſunk down half dead in a ſwound, and with much ado be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refreſhed by the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> he came to himſelf. But when he heard the cauſe of the Aſſembly, he anſwered, That as it was diſpleaſing to him that his Subjects were ſo much offended at him, ſo he was well pleaſed that they had made his Son <hi>Edward</hi> King in his ſtead; and ſo the Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being rightly performed, the buſineſs was at laſt accompliſhed. Then an allowance being granted to <hi>Edward,</hi> he remained in the Cuſtody of the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and was well uſed. Alſo ſo great a ſtipend was granted to the Queen-Mother, that there was ſcarce any thing left for the King and Queen. Nor was the furious woman yet pleaſed, but went about to infringe the Liberty her Husband enjoyed with the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and by the counſel of <hi>Adam Torleton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> power is granted to two Knights <hi>Thomas Gorney</hi> and <hi>John Matrevers</hi> to carry the King to ſome other place. They hewed him filthily, cutting his hair moſt ridiculouſly, and his heard alſo, that he might not be known, at laſt they brought
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119698:51"/>him to <hi>Barclay</hi>-Caſtle.</p>
               <p>After he had loſt his Kingdom, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult concerning his Life. Firſt, They thought by unwholſome food to deſtroy him, then by filthy ſtinks of carcaſes, and laſtly by poyſon, but neither prevailed. Then the Letters of the Biſhop of <hi>Hereford</hi> the moſt wicked Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, were ſent to his Keepers, by which he checks them heavily for dealing ſo well with him that was not fit to be ſo kindly uſed, adding in the end, <hi>Doe not fear to kill</hi> Edward, <hi>'tis good;</hi> which was interpreted by them, as they pleaſed, who thereupon fell upon the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable King in his Bed, and ſtrive with the Blankets to ſtrangle him. Nor were they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this, but they thruſt a hot Iron into his Fundament, and ſo burned his Bowels (a moſt hideous Example of Cruelty) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed him in a dolefull manner. But theſe Parricides when they looked for a Reward for their Villany, they received a juſt Reward of it; For being called in queſtion for their Lives, they were baniſhed. Afterwards <hi>Gorney</hi> loſt his Head, <hi>Matrevers</hi> after a long baniſhment at laſt died miſerably.</p>
               <p>This King was of an excellent Stature of Body, wonderfull ſtrong, but too much given to drunkenneſs, and ſo not ſecret of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, he was immoderate toward thoſe he loved;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119698:51"/>For Love, if it be with Moderation is a moſt noble affection of the ſoul, and if that be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is the worſt paſſion of all the reſt. He was more unhappy than unfortunate. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all in Chaſtity, for he left no Baſtards behinde him; In Moderation, for he uſed no unjuſt wayes to pole his Subjects of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys. As his Subjects hated him in his life time, ſo his memory was dear unto them after his Death.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Edward</hi> ſuppoſing it was in vain to ſtay at the report of this news, provided for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for <hi>France,</hi> and finding a ſtrong Navy of King <hi>Philips</hi> in the Haven of <hi>Sluſe,</hi> he collecting a great Fleet ſet upon the <hi>French,</hi> and utterly deſtroyed their Navy, killing then 30000 <hi>French</hi> with thoſe that were drowned and came to their ends other waies.</p>
               <p>Then he laid ſiege to <hi>Tourney,</hi> which Town
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119698:53"/>was ſo well defended by the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Armeniac,</hi> that his whole Army being diſperſed, he loſt about 4000 men; <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> was much enraged with this loſs, and challenged <hi>Philip</hi> to fight a Duel with him, but the buſineſs came not ſo farre, becauſe it was taken up.</p>
               <p>Yet the befieging of <hi>Turney</hi> was no whit neglected, and <hi>Philip</hi> did what he could to free the City, but <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>Sicily</hi> interceding, and eſpecially <hi>Joan Valois, Philips</hi> ſiſter, there is a ceſſation made for two years.</p>

               <p>In the <hi>interim, Robert Atrebas,</hi> with <hi>Gualter Mani,</hi> and ſome other Nobles, after a great tempeſt, and Sea-fight, arrived at a Town of <hi>Britain</hi> (which is commonly called <hi>Vannes</hi>) and going on Land, ſet on the City that was a Garriſon in a Hoſtile manner, and ſuddenly became Maſters of it; but by the deſperate violence of ſome of the Nobility, the <hi>French</hi> wan it again, and wounded <hi>Robert,</hi> whereof he died ſhortly after in <hi>England.</hi> But <hi>Edward</hi> himſelf moving into <hi>Britany,</hi> laid a new ſiege to the <hi>Vannes;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> coming ſuddenly, they both make themſelves ready for Battell, but by the interceſſion of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ſixt, Truce was made for ſome few moneths, yet it laſted not, who was the cauſe of it is uncertain; they again prepare for their Arms, by which means <hi>Henry</hi> of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119698:54"/>
                  <hi>Lancaſter</hi> ſubdued many Towns in <hi>Guyan,</hi> and in other Provinces, and then he removed to <hi>Burdeaux</hi> for his Winter Quarters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> that he might not loſe his Countrey by ſloth, levying a great Army, regained <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remontium</hi> a <hi>Franc Town,</hi> and <hi>Engoleſm.</hi> But when <hi>Lancaſter</hi> was too weak for the great Army of <hi>Philip, Edward</hi> came to his aſſiſtance with more Forces, bringing with him his Sonne Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> that was yet in his Nonage (for he was ſcarce 15 years old) that he might be trained up in the Warres, who preſently took many Towns, and then he marched toward <hi>Picardy</hi> and <hi>Pontium,</hi> and he either vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or deſtroyed all places in the way. Then he paſſed over <hi>Somes,</hi> a wonderfull example of his Valour, the enemy looking on, and he diſcomfited <hi>Gondemar</hi> more by fear than force.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Philip</hi> ſtay'd with his Army at the Temple of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Germans,</hi> and being enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with ſo great a loſs of his men, ſets <hi>Edward</hi> a day to ſight with him in Battell; he had pitched his Camp at <hi>Creſſen,</hi> expecting with his Enſignes <hi>Philip</hi> his enemy: The Armies both meet, and the Trumpets ſound to Battell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in appeared the wonderfull courage of <hi>Edwards</hi> both Father and Sonne, that day the <hi>Engliſh</hi> got the Victory, and the <hi>French</hi> were routed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119698:55"/>and ruined, the King hardly eſcaped himſelf, and there were found ſlain about 30000 men, the chief whereof were <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia, Charles Alencon,</hi> and other chief Nobles 1500. Another loſs fell after this Victory, upon the Archbiſhop of <hi>Roan,</hi> who loſt about 7000 Souldiers.</p>
               <p>Nor was this the end of their Victories, for it went ſucceſſively in <hi>England</hi> againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> in the Kings abſence, their King <hi>David</hi> with the greateſt Noble men were taken priſoners, and 15000 Souldiers were ſlain in the fight, and the reſt were diſperſed.</p>
               <p>Nor did the General <hi>Thomas Dagovort</hi> fight with leſs good fortune in <hi>Britanie,</hi> for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Montfort,</hi> the principal of the <hi>French</hi> Nobility being taken and killed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> being more high by ſo many and great Victories, neglecting <hi>Amiens</hi> and the Town of <hi>Abbas,</hi> he laid ſiege to <hi>Calais,</hi> that was of great moment, and moſt convenient for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> affairs, whilſt <hi>Lancaſter</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran all <hi>Guyan,</hi> vanquiſhed thoſe of <hi>Xanton</hi> and <hi>Poictiers,</hi> and being loaded with the ſpoil, he returned to <hi>Burdeaux.</hi> In the mean while <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> going about to relieve thoſe of <hi>Calais,</hi> drew near with his Forces, and when he had in vain provoked <hi>Edward</hi> to Battell, having done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he returns toward <hi>Paris:</hi> So they of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119698:55"/>
                  <hi>Calais</hi> being out of hopes of relief, began to treat for Conditions, and it was agreed upon on both ſides, that ſix of the principall Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, ſhould come with nothing on but their ſhirts, with Halters about their necks, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to King <hi>Edward,</hi> all the reſt to have free pardon. Theſe, though they did moſt humbly upon their knees crave for pardon, yet were condemned to be hanged, but at the Queens requeſt they were ſet at liberty, and ſent away with money to defray their charges as they went.</p>
               <p>The King and Queen enter the City in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, they command the old inhabitants to leave the City, and kept the place ſtocked with <hi>Engliſh</hi> families.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> ſtrive to regain by craft what they had loſt by Valour, for <hi>Godfry Charnus</hi> the Governour of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Odomar,</hi> had corrupted with money <hi>Almeric Papienſis,</hi> which <hi>Edward</hi> had made Captain of <hi>Calais,</hi> to deliver up the City, but the matter being diſcloſed, <hi>Almeric</hi> is called for into <hi>England,</hi> who coming, and confeſſing his fault, at laſt he obtained pardon, but upon that condition that he ſhould deceive the <hi>French</hi> of their expectation, and deliver them up to the hands of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> At the time appointed came <hi>Charnus,</hi> and brought the Gold with him he had promiſed, but he was
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:119698:56"/>circumvented by <hi>Edwards</hi> Forces; yet he ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended himſelf, and made work enough for <hi>Edward</hi> and his Sonne both, that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent untill all were ſlain that he brought with him, and he (with a Cavalier of <hi>Ribomantium,</hi> who had twice diſmounted <hi>Edward,</hi> but at laſt was vanquiſhed by him) was taken priſoner.</p>
               <p>But the buſineſs ſucceeded more happily, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> got the Caſtle of <hi>Gnyan</hi> by bribing the Governour, and ſo plaid the <hi>French</hi> the ſame trick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King now died, leaving his Sonne <hi>John</hi> Heir of the Kingdom, alſo <hi>Humbert</hi> Prince of <hi>Dauphine</hi> died, who left the ſame ſucceſſour, and from that time the firſt born of the <hi>French</hi> King is called the <hi>Dolphine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when the Treaties of Peace began, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not, <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> is ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into <hi>France,</hi> who over-running <hi>Aquitan, Septimania, Tolonſe, Narbon, Bourges;</hi> heavy with the ſpoil came back to <hi>Bourdeaux. Edward</hi> no leſs on the other part vexed <hi>France</hi> with new Forces, alſo he ſet <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to aſſiſt the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who alſo Conquered many Caſtles and Cities, wherefore the <hi>French</hi> man raiſing what force he could, firſt laies hold on <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> and recovered many Towns there, and had won all the Province, unleſſe he had
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119698:56"/>been diverted by the inſolency of <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> who came againſt him, but when <hi>Edward</hi> was too weak for the <hi>French</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he ſoon retreated to <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> followed him, and forced him to fight, not willing to forbear the hopes he had of the Victory, although Legates came from the Pope, and ſubmiſſively deſired peace. But the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> ſcorning the baſe conditions ſent him by the <hi>French</hi> (namely, That he ſhould yield himſelf and his Army to the mercy of the <hi>French</hi>) made himſelf ready to fight, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king choice of ſome places that were Vineyards, and over-grown with briars, that he might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the violence of the Horſe, there he planted his Bow-men, who eaſily troubled the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that came improvidently to offend them, and ſo began the Battell, and following their ſucceſs, they diſperſed and routed all the <hi>French</hi> Army preſently; King <hi>John</hi> himſelf, with his younger Sonne <hi>Philip,</hi> and an innumerable Nobility of <hi>France</hi> were taken priſoners; ſeven thouſand were ſlain, amongſt whom were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny chief Noble men. The reſt with three Sons of the King eſcaped by flight. The King of <hi>France</hi> though he were captivated, was uſed with all reſpect by Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> and when he had wintred with him at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſpring he is brought into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:119698:57"/>and is entertained richly by King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> who being content with one Captive King, he releaſed <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at the requeſt of Queen <hi>Joan,</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Edward,</hi> when he had lived in <hi>England</hi> eleven years, firſt paying his Ranſom that he had promiſed. But by the interceſſion of ſome Cardinals, there was a Treaty of Peace between both Kings. And <hi>John</hi> being now weary of his ſtay in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> eaſily yielded to thoſe conditions which <hi>Edward</hi> propounded. But his eldeſt Sonne the Dolphin Prince, and the Counſel of <hi>France,</hi> were not content with them, ſaying they were heavy and unjuſt. Whereupon <hi>Edward</hi> impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of delays, attempts to make good by Arms, that he could not obtain in Peace. He leaving the charge of the Kingdom to his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Sonne <hi>Thomas,</hi> with 1100 Ships, and the Flowr of the Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> ſails to <hi>Calais,</hi> where he divided his Army into three parts: The firſt Body he truſted with the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> the ſecond to <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> the third he kept for himſelf. Then over-running <hi>Picardy,</hi> he wan many Towns, till he ſat down with his Army before the Wals of <hi>Paris,</hi> wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in vain for the coming of the Dolphin, wherefore he retreated toward <hi>Lions.</hi> But in the way he was overtaken with ſo great a tempeſt, in the year 1360, that being mightily
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:119698:57"/>frighted, he made a vow to make peace with the <hi>French,</hi> and not long after it was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Lyons:</hi> In which conditions the <hi>French</hi> King was alſo included with his Sonne, and is releaſed from his Captivity, and great part of <hi>France,</hi> with a vaſt ſumme of Money is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Edward,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> King the next year, (the cauſe why is not certain) came for <hi>England,</hi> and after he had languiſhed long, he died there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> about this time inſtituted the Order of Knights of the Garter, with great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.</p>
               <p>The fame of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was now ſpread through the world, wherefore if any were oppreſſed with injury, or wronged by their enemies, they fled to him for to be their Protector, and to revenge their wrongs: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored again to his Kingdom, who returned him very ſmall thanks for his labour, for <hi>Peter</hi> refuſed to pay the Souldiers their wages they deſerved. The Prince got nothing by it, but grief of minde and body, (if you ſet aſide the fame and glory he acquired of his great vertue.) The Souldiers in the <hi>interim,</hi> being enraged for lack of their Pay, that they might not want neceſſary proviſion, over-run all the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries round about, and commit rapine in all
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:119698:58"/>places where they came; whereupon the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants complain to the King of <hi>France,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>French</hi> King ſets the Prince a day to give an account of this inſolence: He denied to come unleſs he came armed with 60000 Souldiers; ſo this controverſie brake forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to open Warre, and they on both ſides take by force many Towns, and abundance of men are ſlain, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the moſt part having the beſt of it, conquering the Towns of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> and <hi>Belloperch,</hi> where they took the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Duke of <hi>Borbon,</hi> and the Queen of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Philippa</hi> Queen of <hi>England</hi> died, yet her death put no ſtop to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> proceedings in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> falling upon the people of <hi>Aniou,</hi> wan many Towns, and when he endeavoured to take and ſpoil the <hi>French</hi> Navy, by the induſtry of the Earl of <hi>Sant-Paul,</hi> he was fruſtrated, and ſo he returned for <hi>Callis,</hi> plundering all in the way. In the mean time the men of <hi>Angiers</hi> and <hi>Bourges</hi> waſted the borders of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> which when he endeavoured to oppoſe, receiving news of <hi>Lemoges</hi> taken, making haſt thither, he wan it again, killing all every where, but obſerving the Valour of three Centurions, who by their Gallantry checked his Conquering ſword, for
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119698:58"/>their ſakes he ſpared the City, and the Lives of all the inhabitants that were left. <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> died in the mean time, leaving no heir, beſides his Couſin <hi>Robert Stuart,</hi> who ſucceeded him, and was Crowned at <hi>Scone. Robert Canolns</hi> was now ſent into <hi>France</hi> with a great Army, behaved himſelf more boldly than fortunately, for he was circumvented by <hi>Bertrand Geſquinus,</hi> and loſt the greateſt part of his men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> the moſt famous for his Valour and Chivalry, died at <hi>Burdeaux</hi> about this time, and <hi>Gualter Mani</hi> a valiant Captain, died at <hi>London.</hi> Alſo the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> who had married his Daughter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now Governour of <hi>Guyan,</hi> when he was going to his charge of Government, was taken by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and carried into <hi>Spain.</hi> All thoſe poſſeſſions which the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> had won followed, and were recovered again by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, King of <hi>France,</hi> ſo that the chance of Warre now began manifeſtly to alter. <hi>Edward</hi> indeed went thither with mighty forces, but by a contrary Tempeſt he loſt his labour, and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> was carefull of his buſineſs but did nothing prevail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> when he had loſt, (together with his hopes he conceived of his Sonne <hi>Edward,</hi>) all the fruits almoſt of his travell in <hi>France,</hi> fell
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119698:59"/>into ſo great grief of minde and body, that he died about ten moneths after the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> when he had reigned fifty years. He was the moſt valiant of all the Kings, a comely perſon, excellent for the gifts of his body and minde, living as one may ſay after his death, having had a Wife and a Sonne that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable.</p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119698:59"/>ſword, wreſting from the Inhabitants great ſummes of Money, and ſo ſpoiling all the Frontiers of <hi>England,</hi> they are enriched with a vaſt prey.

The King ſaid, <hi>That publick actions may be privately traduced, yet they may not be publickly examined, ſince Authority would in ſuch a caſe commit a fault, and in place of an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour raiſe a tumult, and ſince the loſs is generall and common, every one affords weapons for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and though it were againſt reaſon to exceed the Commiſſion, yet it cannot be held a criminal matter, to engage for it with hazard of ones life.</hi> With good and bad fortune they laboured much
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119698:60"/>on both ſides. The <hi>Scotch</hi> waſte with fire <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſburg,</hi> but the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> entring <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſpoil'd the Territories of <hi>Merchia</hi> with ſword and flame likewiſe. The Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern <hi>Engliſh</hi> attempting to invade <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> alſo are unhappily ſlain. And afterwards the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> with <hi>Buckingham, Warwick, Stafford</hi> and others, the chief of the Nobility, arrive in <hi>Britain</hi> with a great Fleet, thinking to lay ſiege to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Malos,</hi> but finding the Garriſon too ſtrong, they return home again. The <hi>Scotch</hi> in the mean while ſetting ſcaling ladders to the Caſtle of <hi>Barwick,</hi> overcame it in the night, and killed <hi>Robert Baynton</hi> Governour of it. But the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> coming ſuddenly with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, regain'd the Caſtle after he had beleaguerd it two daies. <hi>William Montacute</hi> the Kings Embaſſadour at <hi>Callis,</hi> was ſucceſsfull in his buſineſs both by Sea and Land. But <hi>John Clark</hi> was as unfortunate, though he behaved himſelf valiantly, being conquered and taken by the enemy, both he and his Ships. And ſo here and elſewhere they ſtrove with doubtfull fortune.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Thomas Cartonius</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for Treaſon by <hi>John Anſler,</hi> that he had for money given up to the <hi>French</hi> the Caſtle of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Saviour. Cartonius</hi> denying the fact, is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119698:60"/>challenged by <hi>Anſler</hi> to fight a Duel with him, wherein <hi>Carton,</hi> though he were farre ſtronger in Limbs and force than <hi>Anſler,</hi> is killed by him; At the beginning of the fourth year of King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Raign, the Earl of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was ſent with others, and a ſmall Army into <hi>France,</hi> to aſſiſt the Duke of <hi>Brittain,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> King dying about that time, Peace was confirmed between the new King and the Duke. But the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Galleys did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſpoil the Sea-Towns of <hi>England</hi> at that time, and many Towns were either plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd or conſumed by fire, ſo laden with the prey they returned home.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Kentiſh</hi> men by reaſon of the deadly burden of Tributes, grew mad, and are enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with an implacable hatred againſt the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, taking all occaſions they could finde, for the baſeſt dregs of men commonly being uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of honour themſelves, which they cannot ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain, are envious againſt thoſe that are.

To whom other ſeditious fellows, and whole Provinces joyned themſelves. This tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuary Faction increaſed mightily, came to <hi>London</hi> with his Army, and kils firſt of all <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Lyon</hi> a <hi>London</hi> Doctor with an Ax. And
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119698:61"/>putting his Head on the top of his Spear carries it for a Trophie of his valour. Then all of them the next day runne to <hi>Lancaſter</hi>-Hall, and ſet it on fire, they take away the rich Hangings, and throw them into the Thames, carefully looking to it that no man ſhould keep any thing for himſelf, and when one covetous fellow had hid a ſilver Cup in his boſome, they take the man and threw him into the fire alive, with the Cup. Part of them got into the Wine-cellar, who being half oppreſſed with the Houſe falling down, lived ſeven dayes after the great down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall, imploring no ſuccour to help them. After this manner, plundering up and down, they runne madding to every place; At laſt they haſten to the Kings Court, and to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and they quickly overcome the Tower, the King not daring to make oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt them, where the Queen-mother, ſuffering an affront by a certain inſolent fellow that offered her a bone, fell down half dead, <hi>Simon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> being haled out of the Tower, had his Head cut off at Tower-hill by them, <hi>Robert Hallius</hi> endured the ſame death, and ſo did many others; They neither regarded Churches nor publick places, they deſtroy all in their fury like mad men.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119698:61"/>what they had done, endeavours to pacific the Rabble. The Inhabitants of the County of <hi>Eſſex</hi> are obedient, and return home. But the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> men perſiſt in their ſtubbornneſſe, <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> being their Leader: To whom, in the Kings Name <hi>John Newton</hi> was ſent, that he might by intreaty reduce theſe inſolent people to their Duty, or elſe ſhould enquire what they would have; He coming riding on Horsback, was commanded by <hi>Tylor</hi> to alight, and to deliver his Meſſage on foot (ſo much Authority did he arrogate to himſelf in this fury) the Knight refuſed to come from his Horſe, whereupon <hi>Tyler</hi> comes at him with his Sword: The King loath to have the Knight endanger'd, intreats him to alight, the Knight refuſing it, and <hi>Tyler</hi> urging him, at laſt came <hi>William Walworth</hi> the Maior of the City, and with the ſtaff he had in his hand he gave <hi>Tyler</hi> a grievous wound on the Head, and according to his Office bid him ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the King; Whilſt he ſtood reeling with this blow, he was killed by the Kings followers with innumerable wounds. The Captain being flain, the maimed faction ſeemed to prepare for to be revenged; But the King, though he were yet under fifteen years of age, paſſed on to them with a ready minde, promiſing that he would be their Commander, and bad them fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and all ſhould be as they deſired. In
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:119698:62"/>the mean while <hi>Walworth</hi> had gathered together about a thouſand Citizens, the Captain whereof was <hi>Robert Conolus,</hi> and coming upon them as they were in a Tumult, he put them in ſuch a fright, that they caſt away their Arms, and were glad to ſubmit. The Citizens had fallen upon the Rebels, but the King would not ſuffer them, leaſt they ſhould kill the Innocent with the offendours: That the tumult might be wholly ended, he gave each man leave to return home to his habitation. But elſewhere the ſame quiet was not procured; For in <hi>Suffolk</hi> they ran madding up and down unmeaſurably, and pulled down ſome Judges houſes, and ſo at <hi>Cambridge</hi> and in other places, killing, cutting off the Heads, and otherwayes miſerably maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacring the Nobility; Their Captain was <hi>John Litteſter</hi> a Diar, who was grown ſo lofty that he behaved himſelf like a King. But he with all his followers was ſuppreſſed by <hi>Henry Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> an induſtrious and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant man, who took him priſoner, and brought him to Execution. At <hi>London</hi> alſo, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where they proceeded againſt the guilty, where <hi>John Straw,</hi> and others are put to death, and ſo all this Tumult was ended. <hi>Lancaſter</hi> in the mean while was ſent againſt the <hi>Scotch,</hi> that he might perpetually obſerve them, if they ſhould attempt any thing upon the occaſion of theſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119698:62"/>diſorders. But he ſo wiſely managed the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that before they had any rumour of his March thitherward, there was a Ceſſation granted for two or three years. In the interim, <hi>Anna</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> the Emperour came to <hi>London</hi> to be married to the King, where the Marriage was ſolemnized with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull pomp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry Spencer</hi> about that time had obtained an Army from the King, which he led againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and chiefly for Pope <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Clement</hi> the Anti-pope; And firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Flanders,</hi> he beſieged <hi>Iper,</hi> but by a greater force marching out of <hi>France,</hi> he was conſtrained to raiſe the Siege, and when they came beſide <hi>Graveling,</hi> he writ to the King, that there was now a fit occaſion to defeat the Enemy, but <hi>Lancaſter</hi> who had the command, making delayes, it fell to nothing; ſo <hi>Spencer</hi> having done no buſineſs returns home again, and ſhortly after Truce was made between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean while the <hi>Scotch</hi> entring the Borders of <hi>England,</hi> conſumed many Towns and Caſtles with fire and ſword: But <hi>Lancaster</hi> with <hi>Buckingham</hi> going againſt them, when they could not force the <hi>Scots</hi> to fight, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the wrong they had done, ſet fire to ſome of their Cities and Villages, and ſo retreat for <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:119698:63"/>
               <p>But <hi>Richard</hi> to ſuppreſs their Inſolence, to whom alſo the <hi>French</hi> had ſent aid, he with his Army marched into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and finding <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh</hi> without a Gariſon, he ſet that on fire; The <hi>Scots</hi> to divert the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces, fall into <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and lay ſiege to <hi>Carlile,</hi> but hearing of <hi>Richards</hi> approach, they gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving warning to their fellows, return for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lancaſter</hi> at that time with a choice number of Souldiers makes a Voyage into <hi>Spain,</hi> King <hi>Richard</hi> beſtowing on him the Title of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> where he did conquer ſome Towns, and married his Daughter to the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall,</hi> but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being impatient of that Countrey, and the heat of the Ayre, fell into all kinde of diſeaſes, and ſo made a Truce, which a Peace followed ſhortly after.</p>
               <p>On the Coaſts of <hi>France,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> and <hi>Nottingham</hi> being the Leaders, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>French</hi> Veſſels laden with wine were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and <hi>Breſt</hi> freed from a ſiege. But a grievous Controverſie grew at this time in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> between the King and the Nobility, the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> and others; the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> and many other malicious men ſetting them on. They fell to their Arms, but by the milder
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119698:63"/>counſel of others they grew friends again. The Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> leaving the Court of his own accord fell amongſt the Forces of the Earl of <hi>Darby,</hi> and not daring to fight, ſwimming the River with his horſe, he landed at <hi>Bauvais,</hi> where like a baniſhed man he lived ſome years at <hi>Lovane.</hi> And the reſt who were Authours of the Warre againſt the King at a famous ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Parliament, were commanded to forſake the Court and Kingdom, and ſome were put to extream tortures.</p>
               <p>In the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of <hi>Richards</hi> Government, the <hi>Londoners</hi> fell to Mutiny, for a very light cauſe, and the King being wonderfully offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at them for a ſmall ſumme of Money they had refuſed him, he puniſhed them with the loſs of their chief Priviledges, and with the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a great ſum of money. This is the effect of offending Kings.</p>
               <p>After this in a ſolemn meeting of the Kings, peace was ratified between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France, Iſabella</hi> the Daughter of the <hi>French</hi> King, a Maid of eight years old, being betrothed to King <hi>Richard.</hi> For <hi>Anna</hi> his former Wife was deceaſed. The Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> by an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune word blaming the Kings negligence, fell into his diſpleaſure, and fearing ſome ill iſſue of it, with his Brothers, forſook the Court, and entring into a Conſpiracy with ſome friends
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119698:64"/>he attempted to change the ſtate of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But the King under-feeling it, with his Brother the Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> took a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to the Caſtle of the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> his Fathers Brother, when he came there at night he found the Duke riſing out of his Bed, and preſently going to meet him, he was taken by the Earl <hi>Marſhall,</hi> and carried Priſoner to <hi>Callis,</hi> and there was hanged miſerably. Alſo the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> the chief Conſpiratour, and ſome principall Noblemen, are eaſt into Priſon. And he afterwards in a Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing queſtioned for his life, had his head cut off, the reſt being condemned either to be baniſhed, or to perpetual Impriſonment; And thus <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> by the bloud of the Nobility thought to make good his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Dukes of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Hereford</hi> without any other witneſs, appeaching one the other of Treaſon, are admitted to fight a Duell, but when they were both ready to fight, they were commanded to forbear, and ſo to ſpare blood, they were both ſent away to divers places into Baniſhment. <hi>Norfolk</hi> went firſt for <hi>Germany,</hi> then to <hi>Venice,</hi> where he died of meer ſorrow and grief. But <hi>Hereford</hi> who had ſail'd into <hi>France,</hi> and there being inſtigated by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was baniſhed for the ſame Conſpiracy, returned
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119698:64"/>privately home, under a pretence of his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to be redeemed (which the King had brought into the Exchequer after his Fathers death againſt all Right and Equity) but indeed, that joyning with the Nobility he might order the Kings Inſolence. He was ſcarce landed, but the Nobility came from all parts to him, and he waxed very ſtrong. And having now a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Army, he took ſome Cities, and beheaded the Kings chiefeſt Counſellours <hi>Richard</hi> in the interim was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and did his beſt to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> When a Meſſenger came to him of the Commotions in <hi>England,</hi> he was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at it, yet made no haſte, according as the danger required. At length the Earl of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſbury</hi> was ſent into <hi>England,</hi> before him, that he might levy what Forces he could, the King promiſing in ſix dayes to be with him. As ſoon as the Earl ſet foot in <hi>England,</hi> he raiſed with eaſe a mighty Army of <hi>Welſh,</hi> but the King not appearing, a rumour was given that he was dead, ſo part of his Forces went one way, ſome another, but a few ſtood to their Colours; The King at laſt, ſo ſoon as contrary windes would let him, came to them. But when he found ſo much of the Countrey to be fallen to <hi>Hereford,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> alſo by the death of his Father, he quite fainted in his minde, and bad all thoſe men that came to help
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119698:65"/>him to go whither they pleaſed, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing their fidelity, he with the Earl of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and ſome others, fled to the Caſtle of <hi>Conve,</hi> where he found the Earl of <hi>Saliſbury.</hi> Here the Duke of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> who was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Kings Houſe, breaking his white Staff, a ſign of his Office, and ſo renouncing his fidelity, fell off from the King to the Lords Conſpiratours. Then the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> is ſent to the King, who from that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle conveyed him to another place, ſaying alſo that he came to treat with the King for Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Peace, which the King did not refuſe. But in the way the Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he is forced to go to <hi>Flint</hi>-Caſtle, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhortly after <hi>Henry</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> came, who was guilty, and friendly received by the King, and then he related the cauſe of his coming, which was, that he might receive his Rights and Goods. The King granted, and ratified all, ſo they went to drink together, and afterwards mounting on Horsback, they ride towards <hi>London</hi> in a continued voyage, in ſo great haſte, that the King had no leiſure given him to change his cloaths. Then was the King put into the Tower, the Caſtle for the Nobility, and was diligently watched there. And a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was called by the Command of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> though it were falſly given out in the Kings
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119698:65"/>Name, wherein <hi>Richard</hi> was accuſed of divers crimes, Namely, <hi>That he had waſted the goods of the Kingdom. That he had borrowed a vaſt ſumme of Money, and not yet repay'd it. That he had made all the Laws Arbitrary, as he pleaſed. That he had changed the Members of Parliament when he would. That he had Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically taken Power to himſelf over the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Eſtates. That he had corrupted the Judges. That he had cauſed his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle Earl of</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter <hi>to be barbarouſly murdered at</hi> Callis. <hi>That he had impriſoned the Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. That beyond Right and Equity he had put the Earl of</hi> Arundel <hi>to extream Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. That be had depopulated his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. That be had pawned the Ornaments of the Kingdome and Kings out of the Kingdom,</hi> and ſo forward. For which faults they thought fit to deprive him of all his Honours and Title of King; But he that he might ſeem to deſire what he would have avoided, willingly reſigned all his Right to the Kingdom, and freely gave it to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> whom he nominated to ſucceed him, which was ratified and confirmed by the Great Seal. Then <hi>Richard</hi> being brought to <hi>Pomfret</hi>-Caſtle, was diſcharged of his Crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> having thus got the Kingdome, and not enduring any Competitour, one day la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119698:66"/>was heard to cry out, <hi>Is there any man will free me from that hatefull man?</hi> And preſently one <hi>Peter Exton</hi> a Knight, that he might winne the Kings favour with ſuch a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, went with eight more unto <hi>Richard,</hi> whom he ſet upon to kill him, being at Dinner, but <hi>Richard</hi> riſing haſtily, wreſting the Ax out of the hands of one of his Executioners, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led four of them, and at laſt by this <hi>Peter Exton</hi> he was knocked down dead himſelf, by an unhappy blow on the Head, which the Parricides lamented when it was too late.</p>
               <p>Thus the unhappieſt and moſt well-favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> ended his life and Kingdom.</p>

               <p>HENRY of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who was nominated to ſucceed, was crowned King, but that he might not be thought to uſurp that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which he had by Election, he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be eſtabliſhed in his own Right, vaunting that he was the next Heir, being directly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Henry</hi> the third, but that was falſe and counterfeit, for <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>Marſh,</hi> deriving his Pedigree from the eldeſt Sonne of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, had a better Title. To this he added, his Right of Force, whereby he made good the Succeſſion he could not have done by Inheritance; Be it what it will be, he maintain'd it by his Sword. He gave good example when his Right held but weakly, for he made it up by good turns, granting a General Pardon of all the wrongs had been done unto him, but thoſe that were guilty of the death of the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> he brought to a ſhamefull end, abhorring ſo great wickedneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:119698:67"/>
               <p>But after that the Fame of <hi>Richard</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depoſed, was divulged in <hi>France;</hi> King <hi>Charls</hi> was purpoſed to revenge his Sonne in Laws wrongs, and to re-eſtabliſh him in the Throne. But when it was certainly underſtood that he was dead, all that buſineſs came to nothing.</p>
               <p>Alſo thoſe of <hi>Aquitan</hi> and other places riſing about the rumour of the death of their Duke, were pacified by Meſſengers ſent to them in time. When he had got the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by troubles, it could not be but that he muſt hold it with troubles alſo. For <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Exceter</hi> with <hi>John Montacnte, Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> his Nephew, <hi>Hugh Spencer</hi> and others conſpired to invite <hi>Henry</hi> to <hi>Oxford</hi> under pretence of Running a Tilt, thinking to kill him treacherouſly at this exerciſe. But the matter was diſcovered and became void. Thee what by fraud they could not do, they attempt to do by open Warre, carrying about with them a certain counterfeit <hi>Richard</hi> (for he was not yet ſlain) and they labour to reſtore him, as one that was miſerably wronged, but their Forces running from them, either by fear or diſtruſt, the Authours of it were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and cruelly put to death. The <hi>Welſh</hi> alſo about that time, as their cuſtome was, make new Commations, but the King came oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119698:67"/>with his Army, and eaſily diſperſed them, puniſhing the chief of them. Whilſt theſe things were in motion <hi>George Dumbar</hi> fled into <hi>England</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> craving aſſiſtance againſt <hi>David</hi> the Sonne of the King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> for he had Divorced the Daughter of this <hi>George,</hi> that was betrothed to him, and had married ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wife, not reſtoring the Dowry of the former. Wherefore both of them making a Sally into <hi>Scotland,</hi> fought firſt on equal terms with the Adverſaries, but at laſt they rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and came back loaded with great ſpoil.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> knowing that the King was taken up with the Commotions in <hi>Wales,</hi> joyning to himſelf <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Stafford,</hi> his Couſin by his Brothers ſide, with an Army, and the <hi>Scotch</hi> to boot, who naturally hated the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> beyond meaſure, makes Warre againſt the King; But the King, leaſt by delayes the miſchief might encreaſe, leaving <hi>Wales</hi> came in time to oppoſe them. When both Armies were now ready, they fell to it fiercely, and fought long on equal terms, untill ſuch time as the perfidious <hi>Welſh</hi> came to aſſiſt <hi>Thomas,</hi> and began the Battel afreſh; Yet <hi>Henry,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Sonne, gave wonderfull teſtimony
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119698:68"/>of their invincible Courages, running <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> of <hi>Worceſter</hi> through with a Lance, and killing him, whereupon they vanquiſhed the Enemy that was now in ſuch fair hopes, and glorying of the Victory. <hi>Henry Piercy</hi> the King took Priſoner, and cauſeth his Head to be cut off, <hi>Anno</hi> 1401.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> who was one of the partakers, to ſave his Life, fled to <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Dumbar</hi> Earl of <hi>Marſh,</hi> who was now reſtored to his Eſtate in <hi>Scotland.</hi> After this Conqueſt Prince <hi>Henry</hi> makes an inrode againſt the perfidious <hi>Welſh,</hi> and eaſily put an end to a mutinous Warre, ſubduing the Rebels, baniſhing <hi>Owen</hi> the Ring-leader, a very valiant man, but ſeditious, who was ſo brought to great want, and ended his life mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the <hi>French</hi> came to help the Rebel <hi>Welſh</hi> with thirty Ships, their Leader was <hi>James Borbon</hi> Earl of <hi>Marſh,</hi> they ſet Sail, but by a Tempeſt were brought upon ſome other Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> and they got into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> upon which occaſion they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed themſelves of <hi>Plymouth</hi> Haven, and coming on Land, they ruine all places they meet, with fire and Sword; But ſtorms ſuddenly ariſing, twelve of their Ships were drown'd, ſo they began to think how to return back, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119698:68"/>haſtily giving warning to the reſt, laden with their prey they came again to <hi>France.</hi> But <hi>Thomas</hi> the Sonne of King <hi>Henry,</hi> with his Navy brought together, depopulated the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>France,</hi> and taking many Merchants<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſufficiently requited this Injury. But the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> being full of troubles at home, and ſo thinking leſſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, made a Truce for ſome Moneths. The King untill that time being a Batchelour, took to Wife <hi>Joan</hi> that was formerly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Duke <hi>Montfort,</hi> and eſpouſed her Daughter <hi>Blanch</hi> to the Sonne of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At that time <hi>William Plunton,</hi> a valiant war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Knight, conſpired againſt the King, with the Friends of <hi>Mowbray,</hi> who (as we ſaid lived baniſhed at <hi>Venice</hi>) To theſe the men of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> and laſtly the <hi>Scotch</hi> united them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The King being certain of this matter, comes preſently with an Army, and eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated them: <hi>Plunton</hi> and ſome of his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with <hi>Richard Scroop</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> who was ſaid to have had a finger in this Rebellion, was taken priſoner. <hi>Plunton</hi> by the generall vote loſt his Head for his inſolence, and afterwards the reſt were put to death, being convicted of this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:119698:69"/>
               <p>The King to extinguiſh Rebellion quite, ſent his Sonne <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were coming on to aſſiſt <hi>Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> but they, when they had heard that the Conſpiracy was detected, and the Authours of it executed, were not come from their places. But <hi>Henry</hi> that he might not loſe his labour, enters <hi>Scotland,</hi> and waſtes it miſerably with fire and Sword, and ſtruck a wonderfull terrour upon the <hi>Scots,</hi> ſo load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with the ſpoil and booty, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns back to his Father to <hi>London,</hi> who was vexed to the purpoſe with new Commotions daily riſing one out of another upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.

               <p>THis King was inaugurated with a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full applauſe and deſire of the Lords and Commons; and he not willing to diſappoint his ſubjects of the hope they conceived of him,

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119698:71"/>inferiour in forces; they preſently fall on, but <hi>Henry</hi> joyning induſtry to his vertue, giving ſuch a violent charge, that after a terrible fight on both ſides, he put the <hi>French</hi> at laſt to their heels. He himſelf being in the midſt of the enemies forces, diſmounted the Duke of <hi>Alen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> who was preſently ſlain by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſouldiers; they had ſo many priſoners, that they farre exceeded the Conquerours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he commanded to kill them all, leaſt they ſhould riſe againſt them that had ſubdued them. There was a wonderfull multitude of Dukes, Earls and Lords that were deſtroyed, and not above 600 of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> wanting, amongſt which, one was the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> This Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell was fought at <hi>Dagincourt,</hi> which gave a good <hi>omen</hi> to great Victories afterwards. <hi>Henry</hi> by this Victory caſt ſuch a terrour on the <hi>French,</hi> that <hi>Lewis</hi> the Dolphin, taking grief of minde died ſhortly after.

               <p>In that time <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperour came to <hi>England</hi> to treat of Peace between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor was <hi>Henry</hi> ſlow in the buſineſs; but when the <hi>French</hi> in the

But the Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi> coming ſuddenly upon them, after a fierce fight diſperſed them, and vanquiſhed the reſt. He took the Duke of <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> a Baſtard, and ſo returned Conquerour for <hi>England.</hi> Then the King with his chief Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſailed into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and Conquered the Fort <hi>Tucha,</hi> whilſt the Earl of <hi>Saliſbury</hi> wan <hi>Albervill,</hi> which place the King gave freely to him and his heirs.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:119698:72"/>the City, the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> leading them on, and ſetting on the Guard, put them all to flight, and ſo the whole Army found entrance, ſome of the principall for their perverſneſs were put to death, and the plunder of the City was given to the Souldiers. The Governour had not yet yielded the Fort, but when the King ſware he would ſpare none if they continued reſolute, at laſt he gave it up. The <hi>French</hi> in the mean while being in Civil broils, all things went with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as they pleaſed. He ſent the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> to beſiege the Town of <hi>Bayon,</hi> which he quickly wan, whilſt he ſtaid at <hi>Caen,</hi> he reſtored to the people of <hi>Lyons</hi> a mighty maſs of Treaſure, that was found in the Caſtle, which the frighted people had brought thither, upon condition that they ſhould be conſtant in their obedience for the future: This was a pattern of his wonderfull piety. Then he removed to <hi>Corfen,</hi> and in three daies won the Town. Then he ſubdued <hi>Argentani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> after that <hi>Alencon,</hi> then <hi>Faleſia,</hi> and ſo returned Victor to <hi>Caen.</hi> He had almoſt the like ſucceſs at Sea, vanquiſhing many Ships of the enemy; but his own Fleet was toſſed long in a tempeſt whilſt he ſtrove to ſail to <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton,</hi> yet he loſt but two Ships. In the mean while the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Talbot</hi> conquer the Caſtle of <hi>Dumfriſe,</hi> and <hi>Clarentius</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:119698:72"/>maſtered <hi>Curton</hi> and many other Towns. Then the King laies ſiege to <hi>Roan,</hi> and at laſt by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine he forced the obſtinate Citizens to ſubmit, which Town being the chief was an example for the reſt to follow, ſo that ſhortly he wan all <hi>Normandy,</hi> which was loſt by the careleſneſs of his Predeceſſors. The Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> finding all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> deſired to ſucceed, thought it concerned him to procure peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both Kings, and at laſt he obtained a meeting between <hi>Henry</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Queen, (for the King was fallen into his uſuall doting) yet there was nothing enacted. The Queen had brought her moſt beautifull Daughter <hi>Katharine</hi> that ſhe might enſnare the Kings minde with her allurements, nor was it in vain, for <hi>Henry</hi> when he ſaw her was wonderfully taken with her; and when they departed doing nothing, the King laid a charge on the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> that unleſs all he asked, together with the Kings Daughter, were granted him, he would by force take from the Duke his Dukedom, and from the King his Kingdom. They were ſo frighted with theſe threats, that they fell to a new Parly. But the Dolphin, by reaſon of this newly conceived hatred, and burning with former envy, commanded the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> to be killed baſely, not long after, though he begged his life from him on
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119698:73"/>his knees, and ſo the ſlaughter of the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> committed before by <hi>Burgundy</hi> was expiated. Nor is peace yet concluded, untill the <hi>French</hi> were forced to it by a further loſs. A meeting was appointed at <hi>Trecas,</hi> and there was <hi>Katherine</hi> betrothed to <hi>Henry,</hi> and the right of ſucceſſion was confirmed to him after the death of <hi>Charles;</hi> whereupon all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>France</hi> ſwear to be Loyall to him, and ſo the Salique Law in <hi>France</hi> was broken. The Dolphin who had not conſented to theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, is made Warre againſt by the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and divers Towns that took part with him are conquered, and when as he came not upon his citation to appear at <hi>Paris</hi> before the Marble Table (as they call it) upon the day appointed, he was baniſhed. <hi>Henry</hi> alſo uſing his Authority, commanded Money to be coyned with the Arms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> which he called the <hi>Soveraign.</hi> Then leaving the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> Governour of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> he returned for <hi>England.</hi> But <hi>Clarence</hi> making an expedition againſt <hi>Aniou,</hi> and ſpoyling them, as he came back laden with the prey, he was betraied in his paſſage by one <hi>Andrew Fogoſus,</hi> and though he fought valiantly, yet was he ſlain by the Duke of <hi>Alenſon,</hi> with the chief Nobility, and 2000 <hi>Engliſh</hi> men. The Earls of <hi>Sommerſet</hi>

The King to revenge his Brothers death, lands in <hi>France</hi> with a mighty Army, and freed <hi>Chartres</hi> from a ſiege of the Dolphin, for when he heard of the Kings approach, he retreated to <hi>Towrs,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Scotch</hi> King with the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> conquer <hi>Drocas, Henry</hi> purſues the Dolphin from place to place, yet could not overtake him, though he took all Towns in his way, ſo that he joyned in a ſhort time all the Iſland of <hi>France</hi> to the reſt.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>interim</hi> the Queen was delivered of a Sonne at <hi>Windſor,</hi> who was Chriſtned <hi>Henry,</hi> of whom King <hi>Henry</hi> ſpake as a Prophet, <hi>Good God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I</hi> Henry <hi>of</hi> Monmouth <hi>ſhall have but a ſhort Reign, and ſhall prevail much, but</hi> Henry <hi>of</hi> Windſor <hi>ſhall Reign long, and ſhall loſe all, but the will of God be done.</hi>

The <hi>Engliſh</hi> affairs thus declining in <hi>France,</hi> they did not aſſault Cities and fenced places as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, but Caſtles and poor Forts. Alſo <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> waged offenſive Warre with the Duke of <hi>York</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Bedford,</hi> and beſieged <hi>Callis,</hi> but he retreated in time, for the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> arrived the next day with a great Army, who finding the enemy gone, ruined all with fire and ſword. In the <hi>interim</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> laid ſiege to the Caſtle of <hi>Rapesburg,</hi> but being certified of the return of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and the coming of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> he quickly raiſed his ſiege.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Harflet</hi> was delivered up to the <hi>French</hi> at a price, the Garriſon ſouldiers being corrupted with money. But the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> and <hi>Talbot,</hi> beſieging the City afreſh by Sea and Land, regained it once more, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> with his Army being come only to look on. In the mean time <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> after he had been priſoner ten years in <hi>England,</hi> was reſtored to his liberty,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119698:77"/>placed with a rich Matron, but being at length ingratefull, he was treacherouſly ſlain in his chamber; the authours of the fact were ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed. All this while the buſineſs went diverſly in <hi>France</hi> on both ſides; and what by Valour, what by Policy, many Towns were won and recovered again. In <hi>England</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt fell out between the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and a Cardinal his Uncle, the Wife of the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> was accuſed by the Cardinal for Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, as if by Magick Arts ſhe went about to take away the Kings life: She was forced pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to ſatisfie for that wickedneſs ſhe had not attempted, though others that were guilty in their very ſufferings excuſed the Dutcheſs of it. Now by the interceſſion of Chriſtian Princes they began to treat of Peace between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> Peace was not ratified, but a ceſſation was granted for eighteen moneths. In the mean time the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> by his own Authority contracted a Marriage between King <hi>Henry,</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> the Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Angiers,</hi> boaſting much of the Maids Beauty and Doury; at laſt he perſwaded the King, though paſſed his word to the Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Brittain.</hi> This Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony Contracted gave but ſmall help to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> affairs, when for commutation great part of <hi>Normandy</hi> was yielded to the <hi>French:</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:119698:77"/>Alſo the Duke of <hi>Britain</hi> revenging the wrong done to his Daughter, drove all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>Aquitan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the hatred that had long grown between the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> began to bud again. He by fraud and injuſtice depoſed this <hi>York</hi> from his Authority of Viceroy, though he had behaved himſelf gallantly in <hi>France,</hi> and made himſelf Viceroy in his place; <hi>York</hi> being not a little offended at it. For the King did nothing leſs, than taking care of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, all the Authority was between Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> Alſo by the contriving of his adverſaries, the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who was ſo well eſteemed of by all the people, that they pointed at him by the name of the good Duke, was put out of his place, and unknown to the King, a Parliament being called privately, they queſtion him for his life, he was caſt into Priſon, where the next day (how it is not known) he was miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly murdered.</p>
               <p>By a ſtratagem the City of <hi>Fulger</hi> was taken by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Town <hi>Larcha</hi> by the <hi>French,</hi> ſo they break out into Warre again. The <hi>French</hi> deſpiſing <hi>Sommerſet</hi> for his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, who (as we ſaid) had now all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wan many Towns, and in <hi>Guyan</hi> divers willingly fell off to the <hi>French,</hi> amongſt which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:119698:78"/>was <hi>Roan,</hi> following the example of the reſt, and more miſchief befell the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Alſo the Cities of <hi>Harflet</hi> and <hi>Caer,</hi> though they were valiantly defended, yet by the careleſneſſe of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> the Governour, were delivered up to the <hi>French,</hi> who ſo almoſt with no pains wan all <hi>Normandy,</hi> and made good all <hi>France</hi> for themſelves, except <hi>Callis.</hi> The Duke of <hi>York</hi> who ſhould now help the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> was fain to go to ſtill the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that were up, he quickly pacified them, whereby he wan the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hearts very much, and much augmented his own affairs.</p>
               <p>But when all things went not as they ſhould do in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Sommerſet</hi> was held to be the cauſe of all, and after him <hi>Suffolk.</hi> Many complaints by conſent of the Lower-Houſe of Parliament were alleadged againſt him, whereof he was found guilty, and caſt into Priſon, but he is ſuddenly ſet at liberty: But a new ſitting being ſummoned at the inſtance of the Lower-Houſe he was baniſhed for five years, but whilſt he ſailed into <hi>France,</hi> he was intercepted by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and his Head cut off, leaving his Body diſgracefully on the ſhore, and ſo the death of the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> was paid for. <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> in the mean time having won the <hi>Iriſh</hi> hearts, gave the firſt ſtep to end the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between the White Roſe and the Red,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119698:78"/>and for a beginning of his own Right to the Crown, for he deſcended from <hi>Lyonel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> the third Son to the third <hi>Edward.</hi> Nor was it difficult to change the ſtate of the Kingdom, when ſo many abuſes and errours that were ſo well known to the common people, were crept in. And King <hi>Henry</hi> wholly unfit for the Government, as the people would ſay, by whoſe fooliſh negligence, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> were loſt. The men of <hi>Kent</hi> by the perſwaſion of <hi>York,</hi> gave their Votes to <hi>John Mortimer,</hi> and with a great and well-appointed Army they march toward <hi>London, Mortimer</hi> himſelf commanding them. The Army made a ſtay between <hi>Eltham</hi> and <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and then they ſent up their Complaints to the King and Parliament, concerning the preſent ſtate of the Kingdom, and amongſt the reſt they petition That the Dukes of <hi>York, Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Exceter</hi> may be reſtored to their places, and former favour, there was no anſwer given, but a crying out to their Arms. But the men of <hi>Kent,</hi> when they were come to the Battel, killing both the <hi>Staffords,</hi> who commanded the Army, they put the Kings Forces to flight, whereupon the greateſt part of the Kings men fell off, for they came running by companies to <hi>Mortimer,</hi> whoſe Forces thus increaſed won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully; wherefore the King fled to <hi>Killing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:119698:79"/>Caſtle in the County of <hi>Warwick,</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the iſſue. By his departure <hi>Mortimer</hi> grew more bold, and came to the Suburbs of <hi>London,</hi> and then poſſeſſing himſelf of the Bridge, he came into <hi>London,</hi> doing no wrong to any man, for his Army was very well diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined, to keep down the violence of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, whereby he won the affections of many, but afterwards the Men of <hi>Kent,</hi> being ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with hope of the prey, fell upon ſome of the richer Citizens, which was very ill reſented by all. <hi>Mortimer</hi> was now Maſter of <hi>London,</hi> and he cut off the Heads of ſome of thoſe that were the Miniſters of thoſe Errours, as <hi>John Say</hi> Chief-Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> and his Sonne in Laws, and ſome others. But the <hi>Londoners</hi> deteſting his haughtineſs, arm themſelves, and craving help from <hi>Scales</hi> the Lord Lieutenant of the Tower, with ſuch Forces as they had colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, <hi>Matthew Gogthus</hi> being their Captain, in the night they fall upon <hi>Mortimers</hi> Army, that were in the Suburbs of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Georges</hi> on the other ſide of the Thames; But the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> men repulſe them with ſuch violence that the <hi>London<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> were forced to give ground, and to leave the Bridge to the Conquerours; who hereupon being enraged, fell to caſt in fire to burn the Houſes upon the Bridge, and ſo put a great fright upon the City, and made a great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:119698:79"/>At laſt their heat began to remit, and theſe men of <hi>Kent</hi> began to deteſt the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <hi>Mortimer</hi> had done, and deſired to return home again, which when the King underſtood, he ſent his Seal for their Pardon, and for all his men being gone from him, <hi>Mortimer</hi> was left without a Guard, who thinking to eſcape by flight, was taken and ſlain.</p>
               <p>This Tumult was appeaſed, but a far greater aroſe ſhortly after, for <hi>York</hi> depending upon his Right comes to <hi>London,</hi> under pretence of Complaints againſt his Adverſaries, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially againſt <hi>Sommerſet</hi> (who had loſt <hi>France,</hi> and was now come home) but the truth was to make a Party, he obtained the help of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and the Earls of <hi>Sariſbury</hi> and <hi>Devorſhire</hi> to aſſiſt him, and ſo marching into <hi>Wales,</hi> he quickly raiſed an Army. The King hearing this, prepares his Forces alſo, and collecting Forces he made haſte thither with the Duke of <hi>Sommer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet;</hi> Both the Armies meet at laſt, and the King ſending meſſengers, asked <hi>York,</hi> What ſhould be the cauſe of ſo great a Tumult? Who caſt all the fault on the Kings evil Counſellours, and chiefly upon <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> promiſing that if he were caſt into Priſon, untill ſuch time as he might be tried, that then he would disband all his Army.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Sommerſet</hi> is caſt into Priſon under
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:119698:80"/>a colour, and <hi>York</hi> gave his Paſſe-port, which being done, the King went toward <hi>London</hi> with <hi>York;</hi> But <hi>Sommerſet</hi> who before was caſt into priſon, being now ſet at liberty; accompanied the King, and in his ſtead <hi>York</hi> was brought like a Priſoner before the King. At laſt they come to <hi>London,</hi> and there grew a hot diſpute between theſe two Dukes, before the Kings Councel, the one accuſing the other of Treaſon, the matter came at laſt to this head, That <hi>York</hi> ſhould take a ſolemn Oath to be true to the King, and ſhould go toward his Caſtle <hi>Wigmore,</hi> for the report was that <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Marſh,</hi> Sonne and Heir to <hi>York,</hi> was now drawing up with an Army. And in the mean time a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger came from <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> craving help againſt the <hi>French, John Talbot</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bury</hi> is ſent thither, who after he had behaved himſelf gallantly, was ſlain with a Gun. The <hi>French</hi> by his death recover all they had loſt except <hi>Burdeaux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean while the Duke of <hi>York</hi> did his beſt to allure the mindes of the Subjects, and then gaining the Nobility to his ſide, who were all offended with <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> and joyning the Earls of <hi>Sariſbury</hi> and <hi>Warwick</hi> with him, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſo farre that <hi>Sommerſet</hi> in the Kings ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was ſent to the Tower. But <hi>Henry</hi> when he heard that, though he were ſick, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:119698:80"/>to <hi>London,</hi> he not only ſets him at Liberty, he makes him Governour of <hi>Callis,</hi> and of all the other places in <hi>France,</hi> which thing ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked <hi>York,</hi> that he and his Aſſiſtants March to <hi>London</hi> with a great Army. The King with <hi>Sommerſet, Buckingham,</hi> and his Sonne <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Army goes againſt them. At S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Albans</hi> the Armies came in ſight one of the other. <hi>York</hi> ſent Letters in the Morning to the King, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Sommerſet</hi> to be delivered up to him, that he might be tried, the King refuſing this, he makes the firſt On-ſet, <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> and with him the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Humphrey</hi> Earl of <hi>Stafford</hi> fell in the Battel, and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men with them. Many were wounded and taken: The King himſelf, who had fled into a Countrey-mans houſe for fear of the weapons, was taken by the Conſpiratours; This Battel fell on <hi>May</hi> the 23<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his Raign. But <hi>York,</hi> when his Adverſary was dead, commands his Followers to abſtain from fighting, and goes with the King to <hi>London.</hi> Then a Parliament was called, and he is freed from all fault, and made Protector of the King and Kingdome. The Earl of <hi>Sariſbury</hi> was made Chancellour, and <hi>Warwick</hi> Governour of <hi>Callis.</hi> For procuring which places, every one was very watchfull. But the Queen not
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:119698:81"/>enduring the Authority of <hi>York,</hi> ſhe never left urging <hi>Buckingham</hi> with the Death of his Son, and young <hi>Sommerſet</hi> with the Death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and when ſhe had ſufficiently incenſed them, ſhe goes to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and there ſhe holds a Councel, commanding <hi>York</hi> and his Confederates to renounce their Places; But they refuſed to do it. Then with ſubtilty ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with flattery ſhe intercepts them, and did all the miſchief ſhe could, but all in vain, yet they, leaſt they might give cauſe of greater troubles, retire themſelves, ſome to one place, ſome to another. But ſending Meſſengers one to another, they came all to <hi>London</hi> with their Forces provided, and by the Mediation of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and others, there was an Act of Oblivion granted for all that had been done, and Peace was concluded on both ſides, and all is confirmed with a ſolemn Shew of Religion; Yet they held not long, for occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being taken from a quarrel that happened between one of the Kings, and of the Earl of <hi>Warwicks</hi> Servants, they endeavoured to lay hold on <hi>Warwick,</hi> but he fore-ſeeing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, with Poſt-horſe, makes haſte to <hi>York</hi> to the Duke, and to his Father Earl of <hi>Sariſbury,</hi> whom he acquainted with the buſineſs, but he going on board the Navy that was ready by the ſhoar (for he was Admiral of the Sea) made haſte to <hi>Callis.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:119698:81"/>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Sariſbbury</hi> goes to the King with 5000 ſouldiers, that he might acquaint him with the injury done to his Sonne, and of the inveterate hatred of the Queen which was now apparent. But <hi>Audley,</hi> who at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Queen and of the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> had raiſed an Army of 10000 men, went againſt him, and was beaten, 2400 were ſlain, the reſt fled to ſave themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>York</hi> ſuppoſing it was in vain to dally any longer, raiſing an Army, with the Earls of <hi>Sariſbury</hi> and of <hi>Warwick,</hi> he provides for Warre, but a Treaty being had between both ſides, and a pardon granted by the King for all faults, many forſook the Dukes, and all the Counſels of the Conſpirators were detected, with which <hi>York</hi> was brought to deſparation, and fled with his younger Sonne Earl of <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> firſt into <hi>Wales,</hi> then into <hi>Ireland.</hi> When the private ſouldiers had procured pardon, the Earls of <hi>Marſh, Sariſbury</hi> and <hi>Warwick</hi> took their voyage for <hi>Callis,</hi> but ſome of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall were put to death, and a Parliament being called, they were all convinced and condemned for Treaſon. Alſo <hi>Sommerſet</hi> at the Queens interceſſion was made Governour of <hi>Callis,</hi> but when he thought to enter upon his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was ſhot at from the Town, and was forced to betake himſelf to ſome other place.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:119698:82"/>The Queen hearing this began to rage, and commanded all the Ships that were in <hi>Sandwich</hi>-Haven to be fitted for <hi>Callis:</hi> But <hi>John Dynham</hi> for the Earl of <hi>Marſh</hi> his ſake, took them all, and with <hi>Riverius</hi> their Admiral brought them to <hi>Callis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> alſo ſail'd into <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> and conſulting with him, returned ſafe for <hi>Callis. Simon Montfort</hi> was Warden of the Cinque-ports, and guarded all the Inrodes that <hi>Warwick</hi> might not come into <hi>England,</hi> but he being admoniſhed of it by the Spies he had, faſtning upon his Navy not yet ready, he plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and brought <hi>Simon</hi> with a great booty to <hi>Callis.</hi> And when he underſtood that the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> men deſired his preſence, he came the ſecond time to <hi>Sandwich,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> with a great multitude of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility joyned with him; Wherefore being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed with an Army of 25000 Men, be marched preſently to <hi>London,</hi> and poſſeſſed himſelf of the Tower, whereby he afterwards did the <hi>Londoners</hi> a great deal of miſchief. But hearing that his Father the Earl of <hi>Sariſbury</hi> was coming on, he paſſed over the Thames and joyned with him.</p>
               <p>The King with the Dukes of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> and a well appointed Army, marches againſt them, at <hi>Northampton</hi> he came
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119698:82"/>in ſight of the Enemy. The Battel began on both ſides, and they fought vehemently, <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> with <hi>John Talbot,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Shrewſbury, Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Egremont, John Bellomont,</hi> and others were ſlain, and on one and the other ſide ten thouſand men. This was in the year 1460. The Queen eſcaped with the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> and his Sonne, but the King more mindfull of his prayers than of the Battel, was taken and brought priſoner to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Warwick</hi> preſently got poſſeſſion of the Tower, and <hi>Scales</hi> the Lieutenant, whileſt he thought to get away croſſing the Thames in a diſguiſe, was diſcovered, taken and beheaded. The Duke of <hi>York</hi> receiving Meſſage of this Succeſs, leaving <hi>Ireland,</hi> came Poſt for <hi>London,</hi> where at a ſolemn meeting, he layes open his Right to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> deriving his Pedigree from <hi>Lyonel</hi> the third, Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, the elder brother of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> the Father of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth the Uſurper. But he deſired not the Kingdom, unleſs his Right were made clear to all men; Wherefore a Councel being held, the Title of a King is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to King <hi>Henry</hi> ſo long as he lived, and <hi>York</hi> is named to ſucceed him. The Queen all this while muſtering an Army in <hi>Scotland,</hi> invades <hi>England</hi> daily; <hi>York</hi> with his younger Sonne of <hi>Rutland,</hi> and with the Earl of <hi>Sarisbury</hi>

This was the end of <hi>Richard Plantaganet</hi> Duke of <hi>York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Marſh</hi> hearing of his Fathers death, managed his buſineſs with more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency now than before, raiſing an Army of 23000 Men, he overcame the Earls of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Ormont</hi> alive, he took <hi>Owen Tewdor</hi> alive, who had married <hi>Katharine,</hi> Mother to <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and chopped off his Head.

Then there was a Treaty of Peace, and Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers being ſent on both parts, the King being animated with hopes of Agreement, dealt the more ſecurely, which <hi>Warwick</hi> was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, and therefore falling upon the Kings Tents at night, killing the Guard, he takes the King priſoner, who never dreamt of it, and ſends him firſt to <hi>Warwick,</hi> then into <hi>Yorkshire</hi> to <hi>Middleham</hi> Caſtle to be ſecured. But the King flattering the Keepers, and bribing them with money, by their connivance ſhortly came to <hi>York,</hi> where the Citizens received him lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, and ſo raiſing an Army by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Haſtings,</hi> he came ſafe to <hi>London.</hi> Then there began a Treaty at <hi>London</hi> for Peace, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Warwick</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> were come, but this had no effect. For they being ſtomackfull, and very furious, the matter could
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:119698:85"/>not come ſo farre as Peace, wherefore all being left undone, they depart, and <hi>Warwick</hi> muſters new Forces, of which he makes <hi>Robert Wells</hi> ſonne to <hi>Richard,</hi> Commander in Chief. But the King when he found he muſt engage again in Battel, beſides his expectation, ſent for <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> Father <hi>Richard,</hi> and his Kinſman <hi>Thomas Dimoke</hi> Knight to come to him, who came upon the Kings promiſe of free Conduct; The King commanded them to call off <hi>Robert</hi> from taking Arms, and muſtering Forces ſuddenly, he goes againſt them with <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Richard,</hi> and when they were come to the Enemy, and found that <hi>Robert</hi> would not hearken to his Fathers admonitions, but held up his Arms ſtill, he contrary to his promiſe (a moſt wicked exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) cauſeth both the Father and Kinſman to loſe their Heads. They fell to fighting, and <hi>Roberts</hi> Forces were diſcomfited, he himſelf was taken alive, and immediately was beheaded. <hi>Warwick</hi> at the news hereof, with the Duke, not knowing what courſe to ſteer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:119698:85"/>and promiſe made on both ſides, that they would never ceaſe untill the Kingdom ſhould be reſtored either to <hi>Henry,</hi> or to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> his Sonne. A mighty Army is raiſed, and a vaſt Fleet rode at Anchor in the mouth of the <hi>Sienna.

So ſoon as he was landed, and it was publiſhed that he was arrived, 'tis wonderfull what multitudes of people ran to him, with which being fortified, he preſently moves toward <hi>London.</hi> But <hi>Edward</hi> not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting an Enemy, and leaving the care of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Forces till another time, with his Brother <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> took ſhipping at <hi>Lyn</hi> a Sea Town, and ſailed into <hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> to his own great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Queen <hi>Elizaboth</hi> being near to her travell, fled to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and made that her <hi>Aſylum,</hi> where ſhe was deliverd of her Sonne <hi>Edward.

               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> in the mean time nothing diſmay'd at this change, raiſing an Army (by the help of <hi>Charles</hi>) of 12000 Men, and with 18 Ships, landed in <hi>Yorkshire.</hi> His Army was ſo ſmall, that he durſt attempt nothing, only ſent to perſwade the people there, but all in vain, for they either by fear or for reſpect to <hi>Warwick,</hi> would not falſifie their promiſe; but when he gave out that he was come not for the Kingdom, but to recover his Patrimony the Dukedom of <hi>York,</hi> many running to him, he grew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtronger, and ſo goes to <hi>York.</hi> But the Townſ men being warned by Letters from <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> would not let <hi>Edward</hi> come in. He ſpake fairly to the Citizens, and deſired them that they would help their Lord, not to get the Kingdom, but his ancient Inheritance, and ſo taking a ſolemn Oath that he would attempt nothing againſt King <hi>Henry</hi> toward getting the Crown, he was admitted to enter within their Wals. But ſhortly after it appeared more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what his intention was; for great ones uſe to pretend Religion to ſerve their turns, which
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:119698:86"/>they make light of, that with the greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury they may compaſs what they deſire. He preſently put a Garriſon to ſecure the Town for himſelf, and then hearing that the enemy made no great haſte, he marches to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> to whom many Noble men came, when they ſaw him fortified with a ſtrong Army. The very Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> diſtruſting <hi>Henries</hi> ſide, under a pretence of a Parley with his Brother, came willingly to joyn with him.</p>

               <p>In the mean while the fame was that Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> was landed in <hi>England</hi> with a great Army, and was corroborated for Warre by the Earl of <hi>Sommerſet, Devonſhire, Pembroke</hi> and others that joyned with her. Wherefore <hi>Edward</hi> being ſure to meet the enemy every where, removes to <hi>Oxford</hi> with his Army.

The Earl of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and <hi>Sommerſet</hi>'s Brother, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:119698:87"/>many Nobles were ſlain; <hi>Margaret,</hi> Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> and others, about twenty Knights were taken, and all of them except the Queen and Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> were beheaded in two daies. But <hi>Edward</hi> when he was brought to confer with the King, and he anſwered more boldly than was convenient, he was moſt cruelly ſlain by the ſtanders by, <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence, Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gleceſter, Thomas Gray</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> and <hi>William Haſtings.</hi> The Queen afterwards was ſet free for a Ranſom, and ſailed into <hi>France,</hi> and lived alwaies a ſorrowfull and languiſhing life. <hi>Edward</hi> having thus got the Victory, comes in Triumph to <hi>London.</hi>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:119698:88"/>Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and ſome few of his new friends arrived in <hi>France. Edward,</hi> that all things for the future might be more calm, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the audacionſneſs of the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> men, who had laſt taken up Arms againſt him, partly by puniſhment, partly by threats. Alſo King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> that he might give no occaſion to new ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, was killed in the Tower by the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter;</hi> his Body was buried with no pomp, but the Parricides, and the Authors of his death, (as it ſhall be rehearſed) were afterwards pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for murdering him.</p>
               <p>He had reigned thirty eight years and ſix moneths, he had an honeſt minde, a comely perſonage, and was more like a Saint than a King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> to blot out all the footſteps of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, caſt <hi>George</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> into priſon, who was afterwards ſet at liberty, yet died of grief of minde. Alſo he caſt the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> into priſon, where he kept him twelve years. Others in other places were either captivated or put to death. Then that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels might not fly away to neighbour Nations, he made Truce with <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> for twenty years. The Earls of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Richmond</hi> eſcaped into <hi>France,</hi> where they were courteouſly entertained by the Duke of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> But afterwards, when as <hi>Edward</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:119698:88"/>that they ſhould be delivered up to him, and could not prevail, they were kept more carefully by the Duke. Then a Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called, <hi>Henries</hi> Decrees were nulled, and <hi>Edwards</hi> confirmed, and thoſe that were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed their Country for his ſake, as enemies, are called home again; and the Kings Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer being extreamly waſted, Subſidies are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted. In the <hi>interim</hi> Warre burning between <hi>Lewis</hi> the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> (to whom many Princes of <hi>France</hi> joyned themſelves) abhorring the manners of <hi>Lewis</hi> that were grievous to them; <hi>Edward</hi> himſelf, that he might not be wanting to aſſiſt his friend that he was bound unto for ſo many courteſies, provided an Army and a Fleet and ſailed to <hi>Callis. Charles</hi> was preſently with him, and congratulates his Victory over the Rebels, and invites him that was willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon a new Warre: But <hi>Lewis</hi> being migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily afraid of two ſuch potent enemies, ſent Embaſſadours to <hi>Edward.</hi> The two Kings held a large Conference, who met at <hi>Pictuigny,</hi> where a League was made for many yeares, 70000 Duccats being paid to <hi>Edward</hi> for his charges, and 50000 to be paid yearly, and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Daughter to <hi>Edward</hi> was married to <hi>Charles</hi> Sonne to <hi>Lewis:</hi> And ſo Peace being agreed upon, <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Luxenburg</hi> that joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:119698:89"/>with him in the Warre, being not a little vexed at it, <hi>Edward</hi> came firſt to <hi>Callis,</hi> and from thence to <hi>England. Luxenburg</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taken in fight and loſt his Head at <hi>Paris. Edward</hi> though he had ſettled Peace at home and abroad, yet thinking nothing ſafe enough for him, whilſt <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> was alive, whoſe right to the Crown he much fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; wherefore ſending meſſengers to the Duke of <hi>Brittain,</hi> what by gifts, what by promiſes, he prevailed to have the Earl delivered: But the Duke repenting what he had yielded to, called back the gallant young man that was now gone on his journey to be put to death, and preſerved him from it, ſending <hi>Edwards</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours without their prey home again. <hi>Edward</hi> who was bountifull to all, ſhewed himſelf cruel to none but his Brother the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> whom he ſuffered to be drown'd in a Pipe of <hi>Malmſey.</hi> The Warre began again with the <hi>Scots,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> the brother of King <hi>James</hi> being the cauſe of it. <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> was ſent into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but the <hi>Scot</hi> not truſting to his ſmall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſued for peace. The Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> who was the Author of the Warre, and knew that he was hated by his Brother for it, fled into <hi>France,</hi> and was killed there in a fight on Horsback. Now it remained that <hi>Edward</hi> ſhould
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:119698:89"/>make Warre with the <hi>French,</hi> who had not kept the Articles of agreement, but he was conquered by another enemy which he foreſaw not, for falling into a new diſeaſe not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Phyſitians, he died in a few daies, in the 50 year of his age, and of his Reign the 23, In the year of our Lord 1483.</p>

Alſo <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who after his Brothers death had the chief power, was at <hi>York,</hi> but hearing of the Kings death, he came to <hi>London</hi> with a ſmall Army: For he by order from his Brother <hi>Edward</hi> was to govern the Prince in his Nonage.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:119698:90"/>So ſoon as his Brother was dead, he was mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to uſurp the Kingdom: He coming to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> overtook this young King <hi>Edward</hi> on the way, whom he preſently took into his charge, and ſent his Tutours, <hi>Riverius, Wagham,</hi> and <hi>Gray,</hi> to <hi>Pomfret</hi> Caſtle to be kept ſafe, which thing being known at <hi>London,</hi> the Queen, who well knew the perverſe minde of <hi>Richard,</hi> with her other Sonne <hi>Richard</hi> and her Daughters, fled to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> for refuge, that ſhe might be the more ſecure from <hi>Richards</hi> violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> in the mean time came to <hi>London</hi> with <hi>Edward,</hi> and went to the Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> honſe to reſide. But he not content with <hi>Edwards</hi> being in his power, that he might the more ſafely look to his bufineſs, endeavours to get the other Brother that was fled to Sanctuary with his Mother, under a colour of comforting the Kings ſorrowfull minde; and drawing the Lords to be of the ſame opinion, he ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, amongſt others, <hi>Thomas</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who with fair ſpeeches mingled with threats, brings the innocent childe from his Mothers arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> now having got what he aimed at, ſent him to the Tower in great pomp, but with great lamentation. He in the mean time, what by rewards, what by Religious diſſimulation,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:119698:90"/>and an affected proneneſs of his own minde, laboured to knit unto himſelf the mindes of the Lords and Commons, to cover the great deſire he had of the Crown deeply rooted in his heart, ſo that no man could tell whither his purpoſes tended. But <hi>Haſtings,</hi> a man of an honeſt heart, did daily preſs that due Honour ſhould be given to the King; whom <hi>Richard,</hi> either becauſe he was troubleſom to him, or elſe ſaw too farre into the buſineſs, labours to diſpatch above all the reſt, and ſo craſtily charging him of that he was no way guilty of, he commanded the ſouldiers that were ready for ſuch ſervice, to kill him preſently, he being neither queſtioned nor found guilty. The fault was laid on this worthy man, that he had committed adultery with one <hi>Joan</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, whom <hi>Richard</hi> accuſed purpoſely, as though with the Queen-mother he had made the King impotent by Magick Art. Alſo he caſt into priſon the Prelates of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Ely,</hi> with <hi>Stanley:</hi> but this man was ſhortly releaſed. He ſent others away to other places, that they might not obſtruct his riſing to the Crown. Then by Letters he gave warning to the Keeper of <hi>Pomfret</hi> Caſtle, that he ſhould behead <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verius, Gray,</hi> and <hi>Wagham,</hi> who was over-obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the command. Alſo he ſecured himſelf with a ſtrong Guard, (as the manner is for
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:119698:91"/>Tyrants to be afraid of every thing) and to deceive the credulous people, he had a conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with one <hi>Ralph Shaw,</hi> a very famous Divine, whom the people much admired, ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boaſting that he was the true Sonne of his Father <hi>Richard,</hi> but that his Brother <hi>Edward</hi> was a Baſtard, and he farther deſired him that he would ſay ſo much in the Pulpit concerning his right, unto the people; and that he was a Man, <hi>Edward</hi> but a Childe, unfit for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by his imbecility the Commonwealth might be ruined, and ſo forth. <hi>Ralph</hi> whether for fear or madneſs, eaſily yields to him, and having made a Sermon from a Text fit for the purpoſe, he began to ſpeak freely to the people, threatning great unhappineſs to thoſe men who ſhould preferre a baſtard before lawfull ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The people deceived by the Authority of the Preacher, and frighted by threats, did wonderfully waver this way and that way, and began to prefer <hi>Richard</hi> a Man, before <hi>Edward</hi> a Childe, to wiſh for a change of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to foreſpeak all the worſt, to accuſe the innocent Mother for a Whore. But <hi>Ralph</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admoniſhed of this thing by his friends, and returning to a better minde, was ſo much aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it, that afterward he lived privately and died of grief. Alſo the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> a little after making a ſpeech to the <hi>Londoners</hi> in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:119698:91"/>Counſell, did not ſpare to exhort them, and to admoniſh them of their duty, boaſting more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over highly of <hi>Richards</hi> goodneſs and mildneſs of minde; to him a great part conſented, part followed their leaders, not daring to reſiſt, part thought it neceſſary to obey the time and the reaſon of things, and ſo all ſwore fidelity to <hi>Richard.</hi> In the year 1483. Preſently they go to <hi>Richard,</hi> and acquaint him what was done, he began to refuſe it, and to exhort them to continue faithfull unto <hi>Edward</hi> their young King, to deteſt ſuch a damnable wickedneſs, but at laſt, as it were, againſt his will, he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Enſignes of the Kingdom, and with his Wife <hi>Anne</hi> was Crowned King.</p>
               <p>He labours to make that power good by force which he got by craft, for being compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a choice number of Souldiers for his Guard, he thought himſelf ſafe enough from all injury. Yet he feared the multitude of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> for Tyrants think themſelves ſafe in no place, wherefore he reſolves to go to <hi>York,</hi> having ſetled the buſineſs at <hi>London.</hi> But in the way (when he hoped for no quiet whilſt his Nephews were alive) he writ Letters to the Lieutenant of the Tower, <hi>Robert Brakenbury,</hi> that ſo ſoon as he could, by any means, he ſhould deſtroy the young King <hi>Edward</hi> and his Brother in the Tower, when he refuſed and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:119698:92"/>delayed, he gave that charge to <hi>James Tyrel,</hi> who coming to <hi>London</hi> in great poverty, he ſtifled the young children, cafting pillars upon them. The childrens death was divulged, <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> not being againſt it, it is wonderfull how great amazement ſeized on the minds of all men, every one lamented the unhappineſs of the children, and pitied them, and they began to ſpeak what hopes they had of him, who ſpared not his own near kindred, but ſhed their blood, to ſay nothing of the Mother and her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Certainly immortall God, who will not ſuffer great ſins to go unpuniſhed, revenged on the innocent Children the perjury of their Father committed at <hi>York,</hi> and the death of the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> whom he wickedly murdered.</p>
               <p>But the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who had taken ſuch pains for <hi>Richard,</hi> began now to deteſt his horrid wickedneſs, and ſell away from him, took counſell with the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> who was committed to his cuſtody, how to reſtore <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> (to whom the Kingdom of right belonged next unto, for that he deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> his great Grandfather) and to root out <hi>Richard</hi> a monſter of men: Theſe therefore diſcloſed their buſineſs to others, they preſently ſend away <hi>Hugh Conway,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Ranmey</hi> into

                  <hi>Brittany,</hi> who ſhould acquaint the Earl of the combination, and he ſhould impart it to the Duke of <hi>Brittany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke, though he were much importuned by <hi>Richards</hi> Letters to keep <hi>Henry</hi> in priſon, promiſed aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> in the mean time who had notice of the conſultations of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> ſent for him again and again to come unto him, but when he refuſed to come, they fall to their Arms on both ſides. The Duke muſtering preſently ſome <hi>Welſh</hi> forces and others, came to <hi>Gloceſter</hi> over the River to meet <hi>Richard</hi> that had a mighty Army with him. But the ſouldiers which he had procured voluntarily, rather than for their pay, were not very firm, but ran from him before he came in ſight of the enemy. The Duke was now almoſt left all alone, only his Lacky remained with him, who was forced to fly to ſhift for himſelf, and went to <hi>Humphrey Bauniſters,</hi> he unmindfull of all former favours, delivered him afterwards to <hi>Richard,</hi> who cut off his Head. When this was commonly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, all the Conſpiratours ran one one way, and another another way, ſome to places of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, ſome to the Duke of <hi>Brittany</hi> to the Earl.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> had heard in the mean time, that the Duke did not only not hurt the Earl, but
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:119698:93"/>had reſolved to aſſiſt him, wherefore he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provides a Fleet, that if perhaps the Earl ſhould come, he might repulſe him every where from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> coaſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> in the mean time with 40 Ships, and 5000 <hi>Brittains</hi> ſailed for <hi>England;</hi> but a tempeſt aroſe and ſcattered his Ships, and he almoſt was quit of all his Forces, and was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where coming on Land, when he ſaw a great Army he retreated to his Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping again, weighed Anchor and ſaild to Sea. And being very penſive when he heard of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> death, void of all counſell, he returned again to <hi>Brittany</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> But by the coming of the Nobility he took heart once more, and promiſed before the Altar, to marry <hi>Elizabeth, Edwards</hi> Daughter, if the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould ſucceed to his minde, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh an Oath of fidelity was taken by them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> in the mean time did rage fiercely againſt all thoſe that followed the Earl, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he could lay hold on them. <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> who had fled to him, was baniſhed both by Sea and Land.</p>
               <p>Alſo he made a Covenant with the <hi>Scotch</hi> King, and confirmed it, giving his Siſter <hi>Anne</hi> to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Kings Sonne. <hi>Richard</hi> in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim laies new traps for Earl <hi>Henry,</hi> by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:119698:93"/>the Dukes Treaſurer with money. But he eſcaped them, the matter being detected by Biſhop <hi>Morton.</hi> When the fraud was known to the Duke himſelf, he was ſo enraged againſt the Treaſurer, that he cauſed this wicked man, for that and other wicked deeds to be hanged. The Earl <hi>Henry</hi> was now come into <hi>France,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> eſcaped from his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, came and joyned with him, and promiſed his faithfull endeavour in all affairs: To whom ſome Noble men, that ſtudied at <hi>Paris,</hi> came to aſſiſt, willingly offering their aid, amongſt whom was <hi>Richard Fox</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſeſt Scholar in thoſe daies, whom the Earl took to be of his Privy-Counſell, and when he had gaind the Kingdom afterwards, he made him B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But <hi>Richard</hi> to hinder Earl <hi>Henry</hi>'s Marriage with <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> partly by flattery, partly by fear, partly by promiſes, he prevailed ſo farre with Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that ſhe ſhould entruſt her Daughters with him, and ſhould write her Letters to her Sonne the Marqueſs of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> who was near to Earl <hi>Henry,</hi> whereby ſhe ſhould command him to return home without delay, leaving the Earls ſociety. That all things were now pacified, and that her family was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Kings favour. <hi>Richard</hi> all this while having gotten the Queens Daughters,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:119698:94"/>that he might totally deſtroy the intention of <hi>Henry,</hi> he thought himſelf to marry <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Brothers Daughter, his former Wife alſo was yet alive: But ſhe alſo when other projects would not ſuit, was taken privately away by poyſon. In the mean while he tries all means to win <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to affect him, and if he could not obtain her, he was reſolved to joyn violence to his prayers. But he was ſo much urged with care and forraign fear, that he had no time for luſt to ſhew it ſelf. In the interim <hi>Stanley</hi> had a command to Muſter an Army, but he muſt not go forth, before he had given unto <hi>Richard</hi> for a pawn and pledge of his fidelity, his eldeſt Sonne the Lord <hi>Strange.</hi> A fame was alſo ſpread on purpoſe that <hi>Henry</hi> had implored help from the <hi>French</hi> in vain, and that there was no fear of his coming. <hi>Richard</hi> dealt ſomething careleſly and unwiſely, diſcharging the Navy he had ſent to ſcour the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> was advertiſed how things ſtood, and arrived in <hi>England</hi> with but 2000 ſouldiers in pay. Preſently <hi>Rice Thomas</hi> and <hi>John Savage,</hi> two the moſt Potent men in <hi>Wales,</hi> having col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ſome Forces, came to joyn with <hi>Henry.

               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> all this time was wonderfull ſluggiſh and careleſs, but when he heard of the revolt of his ſubjects, he raiſed what men he could ſcrape up, and went againſt <hi>Henry.</hi>

               <p>He pitched his Tent at <hi>Boſworth</hi> field, when he ſaw the enemy intended to fight, he alſo made ready his men: At laſt they fall on, and fought a ſharp Battell on both ſides. But <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He married <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Daughter to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the fourth, and by that Marriage the old quarrell between the White Roſe and the Red was ended.

               <p>In the mean time a <hi>Scotch</hi> pirate one <hi>Barton,</hi> who was wonderfull bold and valiant, did great miſchief about the Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> the Admiral of the Sea was ſent out after him, after a doubtfull and a notable fight, he was conquered and ſlain, but his followers were pardoned; A great Example of the Kings Mercy.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Warre grew between the <hi>French</hi> King and the Pope; <hi>Henry</hi> admoniſhed the <hi>French</hi> man to deſiſt, and when he could not prevail with him, he proclaimed Warre againſt him, and made a Confederacy with <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, and with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>Spaniard</hi> had intreated <hi>Henry</hi> to ſend an Army into <hi>Biſcay,</hi> and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Forces with his, that he ſhould make the <hi>French</hi> work from that part; Whereupon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <hi>Thomas Gray</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Dorſet</hi> is ſent thither with other Nobility, and 10000 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, he, when he came thither, did not long wait for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> aſſiſtance; For the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> took in the mean time by Force the Kingdom of <hi>Navarre</hi> from the <hi>French,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the profit of his own King. But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that they might not ſeem to do nothing in <hi>Guyan,</hi> ſubduing ſome Towns that were not conſiderable, fell into that neceſſity of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (the <hi>Spaniard</hi> affording them none) that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:119698:101"/>many of them died miſerably for hunger, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting alſo diſeaſes by ſuch unuſual diet, and the reſt break forth into open Rebellion. The Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> who had the diſpoſing of all affairs, whilſt the Marqueſs was ſick, hardly eſcaped from being ſlain; Wherefore he was forced to provide Ships, and to bring theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious people home again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward Howard</hi> Admiral at Sea, did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully depopulate <hi>Britanny</hi> by fire and ſword, and vanquiſhed the Forces of the <hi>Britans</hi> in Battel, though they farre exceeded thoſe he had, and ſo with his Ships laden with the ſpoil, he ſailed towards the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> whilſt <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> at <hi>London</hi> recreated himſelf with Tiltings and other courtly delights.</p>
               <p>In the mean time in <hi>France</hi> in the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Sea, there was almoſt an equal fight for loſs between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Ships, and the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory was doubtfull. After this the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſet upon the <hi>French</hi> Ships very indiſcreetly in the very Haven, with a great loſſe to themſelves and their Admiral, whereby they were forced to ſound a retreat and be gone. Whereupon the <hi>French</hi> began to wax more inſolent, to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief on the Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> and to burn ſome Cities, untill by the vigilancy of <hi>Howard,</hi> who was put into the others place, they were kept in.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:119698:101"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> was reſolved to make a Warre indeed with <hi>France,</hi> and ſent <hi>George Talbot</hi> before with the principal Nobility, and 8000 Souldiers only to <hi>Callis,</hi> then he ſent <hi>Charles Sommerſet,</hi> and other Lords with 6000 Souldiers, he himſelf being to come after them. When the Admirals met they fell upon <hi>Tarvenne</hi> with joynt Forces. <hi>Henry</hi> ſhortly after came to them with 9000 Souldiers, and with a great number of Pioneers. Alſo <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, which was a rare example, took Pay under King <hi>Henry.</hi> Yet though he ſerved under the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he was received as an Emperour ſhould be, and for the honour of his Majeſty. Then the <hi>French</hi> Horſe purpoſing to relieve the City with proviſion, were repulſed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govil</hi> being taken, and 240 more, whereupon a wonderfull fear and deſpair fell upon the Townſmen; ſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> preſſing them ſore, they were forced to ſurrender. The Souldiers had leave to depart with their Arms, the Wals were laid level with the ground, the City, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the chief Church, and the Palace, were conſumed with fire. Then he marched to <hi>Tourney,</hi> and beleaguer'd the City, they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to yeeld, he quickly became Maſter of it, cauſing the Citizens to take an Oath of fidelity. And when he provoked the <hi>French</hi> to fight, and could not make them accept of it, becauſe the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:119698:102"/>Winter was now hard by, he made <hi>Poyning</hi> Governour of it, and returned himſelf for <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean while the <hi>Scotch</hi> at the inſtigation of the <hi>French</hi> fell upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Frontiers. Their General was the Lord <hi>Humes,</hi> who with ſeven or eight thouſand men waſted the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. But <hi>Edward Bulmer</hi> ſuddenly came upon him, and took all the booty from him, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hardly eſcaped, ſix hundred of his men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlain, and four hundred taken. But <hi>James</hi> with an Army of ſixty thouſand men, entred the skirts of <hi>England,</hi> who was met by the Earl of <hi>Surrey, Henry</hi> his Deputy in thoſe parts, at <hi>Bramſton</hi> with ſix and twenty thouſand men, and joyning Battle, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> wan the day by their great valour, and the <hi>Scots</hi> loſt it by their great confidence, <hi>James</hi> himſelf with two Earls, three Biſhops, and eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souldiers was ſlain, no fewer was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; nor was this Victory wan by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> without loſſe of bloud, it was fought in the year 1513.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> coming out of <hi>France,</hi> made the Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> becauſe he had ſo well managed his buſineſs Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and other Lords who had done good ſervice, received Honours as they deſerved. He gave alſo to <hi>Thomas Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> the Biſhoprick of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> This man to be
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:119698:102"/>often named by us, came from a poor parent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to great Honour, and at laſt was made a Cardinal, and governed the Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> very wiſely.</p>

               <p>In the interim <hi>Mary</hi> the Kings Siſter was eſpouſed to the Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> but becauſe the Embaſſadours of <hi>Spain</hi> made delayes, ſhe was betrothed to the <hi>French,</hi> deſiring it, and having had their fill of Warre. But before the matter was publiſhed, <hi>John</hi> the Admiral of the <hi>French</hi> firſt ruined one Village in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>John Wallop</hi> in revenge of this injury burnt one and twenty in <hi>France;</hi> But at laſt a League was made, and they ceaſed from Warre. The <hi>French man</hi> lived not above three moneths after his Marriage, and the laſcivious old man being dead, <hi>Mary</hi> (by <hi>Henries</hi> conſent) was married to the Duke of <hi>Suffolk. Wolſey</hi> about this time was honoured with a Cardinals-Cap, and is created by the King Chancellour of <hi>England.</hi> And Cardinal <hi>Campeius</hi> was ſent to <hi>Henry</hi> to deſire aſſiſtance to make Warre againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> but

               </p>
               <p>At that time <hi>Henry</hi> was in great danger of his life. For as he went a Hawking, the Pole broke that he leaped over the Ditches withall, and he was almoſt ſmoothered in mire and dirt, but his L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Tourney</hi> at this time, upon Conditions, and under colour of Matrimony between the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> King <hi>Henries</hi> Daughter, is delivered up to the <hi>French,</hi> and Hoſtages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given, a League is confirmed between them. <hi>Maximilian</hi> being dead, the Empire deſcended to <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> the fifth of that Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> in the mean while was idle for lack of Warre, ſpending his time in Tiltings, Dancings, Pleaſures, and other Courtly Delights. Then that Peace might not be without its Glory, a ſolemn Meeting was appointed between the two Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> For that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:119698:103"/>a magnificent Palace of Wood was built in <hi>France.</hi> At laſt they met in wonderfull ſtart, they applied themſelves to Turn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Wolſey</hi> in the <hi>interim</hi> did what he pleaſed, he found no hinderance in his attempts whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.

               <p>A new cauſe is given for a Warre between the Emperour and the King of <hi>France,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Wolſey</hi> is ſent Umpire between both, who did not behave himſelf ſo prudently as loftily, whereby he incurred the <hi>French</hi> Kings diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Hugh</hi> of <hi>Moncada</hi> beſieged <hi>Tourney,</hi> and though the <hi>French</hi> did his beſt to relieve it, yet he became Maſter of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> in the mean while, becauſe he had written a Book againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> had the Title given him, to be <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> which hath paſſed to all his Succeſſours.</p>
               <p>At that time cauſe was given of a Warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Scotch</hi> King, by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> and by reaſon the <hi>French</hi> had not paid the Money which he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

               <p>When therefore King <hi>Henry</hi> underſtood, that the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> who commanded all in

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> now thinks ſeriouſly again of a Warre with <hi>France,</hi> and ſends <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and many principal Nobility with a great Army into <hi>France,</hi> who at firſt aſſault overcame <hi>Bell-Caſtle,</hi> and made <hi>William Scevington</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Gariſon. In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Burbon,</hi> Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> revolted to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> King with ten thouſand <hi>French,</hi> who being ſtrengthned by theſe new Forces, enter upon <hi>Picardy,</hi> and conquers many Towns and Caſtles; but Winter coming on, and ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of proviſion, and the Souldiers murmuring, not waiting for the ſupply that <hi>Henry</hi> ſent, he was neceſſitated to retreat to <hi>Callis,</hi> yet he had done a great miſchief to the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scotch</hi> in the mean while ſuppoſing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to be over-buſied with the <hi>French</hi> Warres, lift up their Heads again, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting the Borders of <hi>England,</hi> they win divers Towns.</p>

               <p>So with uncertain Fortune the buſineſs being acted in thoſe parts, there was a concluſion for a Ceſſation of Arms, that ſo they might have time to treat of Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, King of <hi>France,</hi> at that time was conquered by the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth at <hi>Papion,</hi> and was taken Priſoner, which was no ſmall happineſs for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> affairs, but a ſad loſs for the <hi>French.</hi> Then Peace was ratified between the Emperour and the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> agreed with them alſo.

               <p>Peace being confirmed abroad, <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be in an uproar with greater Troubles in Civil Diſſentions; For <hi>Henry</hi> who had lived twenty years peaceably with his Wife <hi>Katharine</hi> had a ſcruple of Conſcience put upon him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could without Inceſt live with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wife? (for as we ſaid, ſhe was firſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to his Brother <hi>Arthur</hi>) Judges were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to end this Queſtion. But Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> who had not prudently dealt for <hi>Henry,</hi> had all

But at laſt other new Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being granted to him, his great loſs was ſomewhat repaired. Then a Parliament was called, and he was charged with many faults, and amongſt the reſt, that he was wont to write in his Letters, <hi>I and my King,</hi> and had cauſed the Cardinals Hat to be ſtamped on the Kings Coyn. He was convicted of all theſe things, and deprived of all his Eſtate; which ſhews a wonderfull example of the inconſtancy of all humane affairs, for he that but lately ruled all and the King too, as he pleaſed, made Laws, and ſwaied Courts of Juſtice, rooted out the Nobles at his pleaſure, burdned the ſubjects with great Taxes, deprived both Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Laity of their goods, he is now caſt down from his high Pinnacle of Honour, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all, and made no way like himſelf.

The King in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim burning with new flames of love, and ſo admitting no delay, <hi>Warham</hi> being dead, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Thomas Cranmer</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> who ſtood for a Divorce of Queen <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine.</hi> The Pope in the mean time gave his Judgement for <hi>Katharine.</hi> But <hi>Henry,</hi> who had now Divorced <hi>Katharine</hi> (by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of many Divines, and of thoſe at <hi>Paris,</hi> who were as it is ſuppoſed corrupted by money) married <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Boloyne</hi> privately, and being thereupon angry with the Pope, he aboliſhed all his Power over the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, making it high Treaſon for any man, to preferre the Popes Authority before the Kings, or ſhould pay Tribute to him, which he had no right unto, and cauſed them to be denied unto him for the future, and made it a penalty for their life, if any man ſhould maintain the Pope to be the ſupream Head. Then he made all the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> take an Oath to him, that they ſhould acknowledge him to be Head of the Church next under Chriſt. The Diſcipline was thus changed, but nothing in the Doctrine, which he confirmed by a Synod called at <hi>London.</hi> For he put to death many of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:119698:106"/>thoſe that followed <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Swinglius.</hi> So <hi>Henry</hi> behaved himſelf in the reſt of his life, that had the Popes not been unjuſt againſt him, he would willingly have ſubmitted himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their power. The Pope being offended that he had loſt his Authority, ſending out his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings or Bull as they called it, he Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> but when it was known that it was procured by Queen <hi>Katharine,</hi> it was the leſs regarded, and ſhe ſhortly after being deprived of friends, loſt her life for her contumacy. In the mean time Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> once Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>John Fiſher</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> who both refuſed to take the Oath of the Kings Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, loſt their Heads. <hi>Henry</hi> now uſing his own Authority, invaded the goods of the Church, and expelled the Monks out of their Monaſteries: Nor was he content with that, but he cut off the Heads of his ſecond Wife <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Boloyne,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Thomas Bolen</hi> Earl of <hi>Wilſhire,</hi> accuſing her for Inceſt and Adultery, together with the Lord <hi>Rochsfort</hi> her Brother, and others that were of the Kings Bed-Chamber.</p>
               <p>Then he married <hi>Jane Semare,</hi> who died afterwards in Childe-birth of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth of that name, who ſucceeded King. Then he Divorced from him <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> newly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:119698:107"/>and for her ſake he beheaded <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi> who made the match, who was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from a mean eſtate to a vaſt power by the ſucceſs of Fortune. Alſo <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> had his Head chopt off, being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of Treaſon, becauſe he had privily mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Henries</hi> Neece. <hi>Margaret</hi> was firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, then ſhe was ſet free, after that ſhe was married to <hi>Matthew</hi> Earl of <hi>Leven,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> his Grandfather. In the mean time ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions aroſe in the North parts of <hi>England,</hi> here and there by reaſon of the change made of Church Ceremonies; ſome were puniſhed for it, ſome were ſent home, and ſome were ſubdued by force of Arms; the troubles were happily aſſwaged, yet not without ſome danger: for it was a matter of great concernment to keep all quiet under new cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> now married his fifth Wife <hi>Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Howard,</hi> but her he beheaded ſhortly after, with the Lord of <hi>Rochsfort,</hi> condemning her for Laſciviouſneſs.</p>
               <p>At that time <hi>Henry</hi> had the Title of King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> when as before he was called only Lord of it. In the interim <hi>Arthur Plantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> baſtard to <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, is accuſed of Treaſon, but when he was proved not guilty,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:119698:107"/>he was received into the Kings favour, but <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi> took ſo much joy at it, that he died the next night of meer rejoycing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scotch</hi> now entring the Frontiers of <hi>England,</hi> and ſpoiling them, compell <hi>Henry</hi> to take Arms, who ſent the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> with an Army into <hi>Scotland,</hi> who ruined many Villages and Houſes, and not ſeeing any ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he returned to <hi>Barwick.</hi> The <hi>Scot</hi> would not ſuffer this violence to be unrevenged, but muſters an Army ſuddenly and fals into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but his men being ſcattered and killed, the <hi>Scot</hi> fell into ſuch grief of minde, and then into a Feaver, that he quickly died of it, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Mary Stewart</hi> his Daughter but eight daies old, Heir of the Kingdom. <hi>Henry</hi> to put an end to ſo great diſſentions, by the union of theſe two Nations, dealt with the captive Lords to Eſpouſe this Inheritrix of <hi>Scotland</hi> to his Son <hi>Edward,</hi> who were ſet at liberty to preſs the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>But by the mediation of the Cardinal of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Andrews,</hi> this Treaty was made void, the Daughter being married to the Dolphin. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was enraged at this, and ſent a valiant Army into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and burnt <hi>Leeth,</hi> which pacified his wrath. Then he made peace with <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, the Emperour, and he married his ſixth Wife <hi>Katharine, Latimers</hi> Widow, who
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:119698:108"/>was brought in danger of her life upon ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the change of her Religion, but by her prudence and humility ſhe eſcaped. Now <hi>Henry</hi> by his Covenant with the Emperour proclaims Warre againſt the <hi>French</hi> King, and ſent an Army unto <hi>Callis,</hi> under the command of <hi>John Wallop,</hi> which joyning with the Forces of <hi>Charles,</hi> beſieged the City <hi>Landreice.</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> making ſhew of a Battell, called the Emperour off from the ſiege, and when he had brought proviſion into the City, he retreated, having deluded <hi>Charles.</hi> Then <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> muſtering a mighty force ſails himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> and beſieging <hi>Bononia</hi> won the place.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships which they had taken from the <hi>French,</hi> are filled with proviſion at <hi>London:</hi> but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had bad ſucceſs in their fight in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Henries</hi> men were vanquiſhed, by which Victory, and new forces they had recruited themſelves with from <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> grew inſolent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>England:</hi> But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the good ſucceſs of the Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi> deſtroyed an innumerable company of Villages in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and returned home Conquerours, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they ſuſtained a mighty loſs by the <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Admirall of <hi>England</hi> with a Fleet did

               <p>In the mean time <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> his Son, are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Treaſon, becauſe they had engraven ſomething in their Coats of Arms that ſeemed to be peculiar to the King, and though they did defend their Titles very abundantly, yet the Earl loſt his Head. But the Duke was kept in priſon till the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary. Henry</hi> died about this time, in the year 1547, when he had reigned 38 years, and was 56 years old. He was a Prince adorned with all gifts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in whom, had he not too much loved his pleaſure, there was no defect. He was a great favourer of Learning.</p>

               <p>HENRY dying, left his Sonne <hi>Edward</hi> born of <hi>Seymer,</hi> by his Will to ſucceed him in the firſt place, and next to him <hi>Mary, Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi> Daughter, and laſt of all <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which he begat of <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Boloyn.</hi> Young <hi>Edward</hi> was Crowned at nine years of age, in the year 1547. Becauſe he was young he had ſixteen Overſeers appointed for him, the chief was the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> Brother to <hi>Jane Seymere,</hi> a man of great integrity. The death of <hi>Henry</hi> being heard of by <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> did exceedingly grieve the old man, who being about the ſame age, did preſage his own death to be near. He kept a Funerall ſolemnity for him, as the manner is for Kings, and not long after that he followed him that was gone before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> at his death, had commanded his Councill before all things, that they ſhould preſs a Marriage for his Sonne <hi>Edward</hi> with the Queen of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Meſſengers are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119698:109"/>ſent to treat of conditions, and to obtain their conſent; but when the faction of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts prevailed for the Dolphin, a great Army was preſently raiſed, and ſent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the conduct of the Viceroy <hi>Sommerſet.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> alſo came to meet him with a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hand, they joyned Battell at <hi>Muskelburg,</hi> but they were beaten down and put to flight, the chief of their Nobility being ſlain or taken priſoners. After this Victory many Cities yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Nobles fell off from them in greater numbers: But that there might be an end made of this Warre and difference, they ſend the Maiden Queen by advice of the Peers, to be Educated and Eſpouſed in <hi>France.</hi> In the mean time there was a great change of the old cuſtoms in the Churches of <hi>England.</hi> Images were caſt out of the Churches, by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> who was addicted to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion; The Sacrament was exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under both kindes, and the other old Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were aboliſhed, all that made oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were either caſt into priſon or loſt their places. Upon this ground a wonderfull ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aroſe in divers Countries of <hi>England,</hi> though the Rebels had ſeveral intentions, ſome came to pillage, others under pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſet forward other deſignes; the ſmalleſt number made it any matter of conſcience. There
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:119698:110"/>was a Proclamation made whereby all were pardoned if they would lay down their Arms; but the more mildly they were dealt withall, the more did this mad rabble increaſe. They beſieged <hi>Exceter,</hi> but the Citizens did reſiſt them with wonderfull Valour, enduring great famine and ſcarcity. At length <hi>Gray</hi> coming with an Army, after ſome ſmall Bickerings, raiſed the ſiege. The Rebels recollecting their Forces, began a new fight, but they were put to flight, or taken preſently and hanged. When this ſedition was quelled, another as great roſe in <hi>Norfolk;</hi> for <hi>Robert Ket</hi> a baſe fellow, had drawn twenty thouſand men to his party, who guarded him that he might deliver up ſome complaints to the King. The King, though he diſdained to treat with Rebels, anſwered them that their Petitions ſhould be granted at the next Parliament. They were not content with this, but they laid ſiege to the City of <hi>Norwich</hi> and wan it. The Earl of <hi>Northam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton</hi> went againſt them with a ſmall Army, and was worſted by the factious rabble, and the Lord <hi>Sheffeld</hi> and others were killed. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrengthned with new forces, he went once more againſt them, and holding forth to them the Kings pardon, they threw away their Arms and left their Colours, returning every man to his place. <hi>Ket</hi> and the reſt of the Ring-leaders
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:119698:110"/>ſuffered for it. Another tumult roſe about the ſame time, which fell of it ſelf, only the Ring-leaders were executed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> in the mean while breaking their League, proclaimed Warre with <hi>England;</hi> and providing a Fleet when they had aſſaulted <hi>Garnſey, Jerſey,</hi> and <hi>Bononia</hi> in vain with an Army, they left off of their own accord. In the mean time the Viceroy of <hi>England</hi> being deceived, beheaded the Admirall his Brother, being circumvented by the femine fraud of his Wife, and condemned him for nothing that was laid to his charge; upon which occaſion both he and his Authority committed an egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious fault: For they that favoured the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall were offended with the Viceroy, and they that did honour him, would truſt him but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſo they all fell from him at once, though upon divers ends. Alſo the Viceroy was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with building a ſtately Palace, (which is to this day called <hi>Sommerſet</hi> Houſe.) And he had demoliſhed divers Temples, Towers, and ſacred places, by which injury he had alienated from him not a little the mindes of all men. <hi>Warwick</hi> who was of his own inclination the Viceroy his greateſt enemy, made uſe of this occaſion, and procured ſome Lords to ſtand with him, and they conſpired together againſt the Viceroy, and ſending meſſengers to the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:119698:111"/>King, who ſojourned at <hi>Windſor,</hi> to certifie him of the good intention of the Lords, they deſired his conſent to caſt the Viceroy into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But the Viceroy, when he would not or could not anſwer the crimes objected againſt him, he ſubmitted himſelf to the Kings will and pleaſure, by which humility he obtained par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and was received into grace. Alſo the Dukes Daughter (to make the friendſhip la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting by Marriage) was betrothed to <hi>Warwicks</hi> Sonne, and <hi>Warwick</hi> was made Admirall of the Sea.</p>
               <p>Then Peace being ratified between the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> and the <hi>French, Bononia</hi> was delivered up to the <hi>French</hi> King, 400000 Crowns being paid to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperour in the mean time, becauſe the profeſſion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion was not allowed to his ſiſter, denounced Warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>England,</hi> but he was pacified by ſuch an Anſwer as was ſeaſonable to that time.</p>
               <p>Alſo there was a Treaty for a Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Kings ſiſter, and the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> Sonne, but <hi>Elizabeth</hi> could not be perſwaded to be married to any man.</p>
               <p>A ſpeech there was further concerning a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between <hi>Edward</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Kings
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:119698:111"/>Daughter, which was ratified, and the Dowry agreed upon.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Earl of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that he might bring to paſs what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, endeavours by all means to root out the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet.</hi> But he to prevent his ſnares, came one day into his Chamber armed, and found him naked in his Bed, and whether he were pacified by his falſe or friendly ſhew of Love and Humanity, he ſpared him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted doing nothing to him. But afterwards <hi>Sommerſet</hi> was accuſed by him for high Treaſon, and loſt his Head for it, being a forerunner of the Accuſers deſtiny. <hi>Northumberland,</hi> when as thus farre all things had ſucceeded as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, was reſolved to follow the ſucceſs, and perſwaded the King at length, that if he would have the Reformed Religion, that was then generally received in <hi>England,</hi> to be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he ſhould paſs over his ſiſter <hi>Mary,</hi> who was ſo ſtrongly addicted to the Church of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

The King who was reſolved by all means to preſerve the Reformed Religion, eaſily yielded to this, ſome others in vain oppoſing it. The King died ſhortly after of a Conſumption, by whoſe death the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> being now
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:119698:112"/>made partaker of his deſire, took to himſelf the Rule of the Kingdom, and commanded his Daughter <hi>Joan</hi> to be publickly proclaimed Queen by King <hi>Edwards</hi> Teſtament.</p>

The <hi>London</hi> Counſell, when they did not hold faſt together, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded openly to proclaim <hi>Mary</hi> Queen, and the ſame was done in all other places. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> when he was certain that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions had fallen from him, that he might not runne the hazard alone, called a Counſell at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and he for want of a Herauld pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> caſting his Cap up in token of joy.

               <p>The Queens Marriage with <hi>Philip</hi> was now ſolemnized, and Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> being ſent from

               <p>The fame was at this time, that the Queen was with Childe, ſhe was ſo glad of it, that ſhe commanded to let looſe many who were priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Towr; Amongſt which were the ſons of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemned to loſe their Heads. But all this hope vaniſhed, when the Queens Conception proved to be but a Tympany.</p>
               <p>That there might not lack Examples of Piety, the Queen reſtored to the Church all the Goods ſhe poſſeſſed belonging to the Church, and when ſhe was told, That by ſo great bounty the Crown-Lands would be much waſted: She anſwered piouſly and prudently, That ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred her ſouls health before all the worlds good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> in the <hi>interim</hi> went to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to his Father <hi>Charles,</hi> and obtain'd from him the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> and his other Dominions before his Death, then he returned for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> Then again he went to <hi>Callis,</hi> to wage Warre with the <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and he ſtaid upon that buſineſs above eighteen Moneths, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> murmuring, and the Queen lamenting for his abſence.</p>

               <p>The Queen, though it were againſt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles agreed upon, put her finger in to aſſiſt her Husband, and ſent an Army, under the Command of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> to aſſiſt him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguer S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Being ſhe was of a flouriſhing age, and had a moſt flouriſhing Kingdom, it could not be but ſhe ſhould be ſought unto by many Lovers, that were at emulation for her. For at once, <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> the Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Angirrs,</hi> ſent to wooe here, but they were all put by; Firſt, becauſe the Queen would not marry, for at her Inauguration, the Condition was, That ſhe ſhould marry no ſtranger, whereby there was hopes left to the Natives for ſo great a Match.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> they hoped to prevail
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:119698:116"/>much by reaſon of her tender years, being alſo ſhe was a woman, whereupon they invade and ſpoil the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Frontiers, for <hi>Mary Stuart</hi> Daughter to <hi>James</hi> the fifth, had married to <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond, King of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King pleaded his Right thereupon to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe his Wife was allied to <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was born by a ſecond venter; <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth his firſt Wife being alive, and ſo was accounted as a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard by her Enemies. But <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to win the Love of her Neighbours, lent help to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who by the malice of the <hi>Guiſians</hi> were extreamly afflicted, and the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was drawn to this head, that Peace was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified between <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> and all the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſled in <hi>Scotland</hi> were commanded to be gone, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours that the <hi>Frenchman</hi> had taken up wrongfully, were wreſted from him. <hi>Mary</hi> when <hi>Francis</hi> was dead returned for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and made a firm Agreement with <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> untill ſuch time as Envy and Ambition growing up, the Agreement was violated by the ruine of one of them, and their Siſter-like Concord was diſſolved. For <hi>Mary</hi> her ſecond Husband ſhe was married to, was <hi>Henry Darley,</hi> Kinſman to the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> and one that was the moſt beautifull amongſt Princes, who being
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:119698:117"/>afterwards ſlain, as 'tis ſuppoſed, by Feminine fraud, ſhe fell into the hatred of all her Subjects, and when after that in ſpite of the Nobility ſhe made <hi>Bothwill</hi> partaker of her bed, and for his cauſe made Warre upon her Subjects, ſhe fell into all miſery, and being captivated, ſhe was kept ſo a long time, but at length ſhe made her eſcape, and fled into <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> who received this miſerable woman in her Arms. She was at firſt liberally entertained, but after, when ſhe began to move Diſſention in <hi>England,</hi> where ſhe was entertained, being a moſt bitter enemy to thoſe of the Reformed Religion, ſhe was kept more narrowly. For eighteen years ſhe was held in priſon, ſometimes with more, ſometimes leſs liberty, untill ſuch time as ſhe grew fierce by reaſon of her Captivity, and to riot in hopes of the Kingdom, laying ſnares for the Queens Life, for that cauſe, at the requeſt of the ſeveral Orders of <hi>England,</hi> ſhe was beheaded. Alſo the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who had ſecretly gone about to obtain <hi>Mary</hi> for his Wife, was put to the ſame death before her. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the mean while ſent aſſiſtance to thoſe of the reformed Religion in <hi>France</hi> that were in trouble, and for a pledge the ſtrongeſt City in <hi>France, Haver de Grace,</hi> was delivered up to her; but when ſhe refuſed to quit it again, the <hi>French</hi> King laid ſiege to it, and wan it from her.</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:119698:117"/>
               <p>At that time a ſharp Diſſention ſprang up between <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, and the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,</hi> which grew to a Warre; and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> led by the affinity of the Religion, and the nearneſs of thoſe Countreys, aſſiſted the United Provinces with Men and Money. For <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was ſent with Forces into <hi>Holland,</hi> but when he exceeded his Commiſſion, and arrogated too much power to himſelf, and by fraud attempted to make himſelf Maſter of the principal Towns, he loſt the States good-will, and returned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out honour into <hi>England.</hi> The Queen for this aſſiſtance was hated by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who had privately before laid ſnaret for her life, but now he breaks forth into open Warre. For he raiſed a mighty Fleet both in <hi>Spain,</hi> and in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> it being the beſt Navy for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of men and munition that ever the Ocean bare, and carried the preſumptuous Title of <hi>Invincible,</hi> it conſiſted of one hundred and thirty Ships, in which were nineteen thouſand two hundred and ninety Souldiers, eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three and fifty Mariners, two thouſand and eighty Gally-ſlaves, two thouſand ſix hundred and thirty great Ordnance, and the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1588. they came within ſight of <hi>England,</hi> and was in hopes to devour it. But by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the Fleet was partly hindred, partly worſted, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:119698:118"/>by a Tempeſt that roſe againſt it, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was diſappointed of his hopes. From that time they break forth on both ſides into a fiery Warre, eſpecially by Sea, and in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did miſchief to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and received the like.</p>
               <p>The Queen, when thoſe Clouds of a Tempeſt at hand were diſperſed, cauſed a publick Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to be made unto God, who had delivered her, and in Triumphant manner ſhe rid through <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She was not for all this free from Troubles, but by the Queens Wiſdome and Maſculine Valour, they were even ſtrangled in the birth; and <hi>England</hi> was made the receptacle of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted and afflicted men, who fled by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> by reaſon of the Wars there.</p>
               <p>In the mean while Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> was ſent toward <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> who made the <hi>Spaniard</hi> work enough in thoſe parts, taking <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting <hi>Hiſpaniela,</hi> and he skirmiſhed in divers ſmall fights, with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces. But when there was no occaſion for a fight on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, he returned home with the ſpoil and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The next year alſo, the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> burnt and took ſix and thirty <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships laden with great riches that lay in
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:119698:118"/>the Haven at <hi>Callis,</hi> and brought them for <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With the ſame Succeſs almoſt the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> with a vaſt Fleet of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> waſted the Coaſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> and landing his men wan <hi>Gades,</hi> and plundering the City, and burning thirty Ships that rode in the Harbour, he came back for <hi>England</hi> laden with the ſpoil. After that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, watching the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Navy that came fraught with rich Merchandize that came from the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> was diſappointed by their flying into the Iſle <hi>Tercera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> being involv'd in troubles, the Queen was pleaſed to aſſiſt the King of <hi>France</hi> with men and money.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> having reduced his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to their Obedience, endeavours to mediate a Peace betwixt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Queen, the Queen to ſatisfie the <hi>French</hi> Kings deſires, ſent an Embaſſadour into <hi>France</hi> to conſult about it; But the States of <hi>Holland</hi> ſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to dehort her from the Peace.</p>
               <p>In the year 1598. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> died, in the ſeventieth year of his age: He aimed at great matters, but was unfortunate in moſt of them, whereupon it came to paſſe, that the three Keys of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Empire (which his
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:119698:119"/>Father ſo called, and willed him above all things to keep diligently) to wit, 1. <hi>Gulet</hi> in <hi>Africa, Fluſhing</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Cadez</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> were neglected; The firſt taken in by the <hi>Turkes,</hi> the ſecond by the Confederates of the United Provinces, the third much impaired in its ſtrength, and impoveriſhed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which his Father fore-ſeeing in his life time, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed to make Peace with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the United Provinces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1599. died that Reverend and famous Divine M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Richard Hooker,</hi> a man moderate, temperate, meek and virtuous, even to the beſt imitation, and left behinde him a living monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his real worth, his Book entituled <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Polity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Peace was confirmed between the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> and the <hi>French?</hi> but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the United Provinces refuſed to be comprehended in it, becauſe they held it diſadvantagious to their buſineſs, but making a Covenant, with joynt Forces they invade <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſtirs up the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> who made a great rebellion in <hi>Ireland. Eſſex</hi> was ſent thither to ſubdue the Rebels, and to make them confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, but he ſcurvily neglected an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conquering the Enemy, and beyond his Commaſſion treats with the Rebels concerning Peace. He was therefore called home, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:119698:119"/>commanded to anſwer for his fault, by his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he found the Queens favour. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward prompted on, either by ſhame, or his ambition of the Kingdom, he raiſed an Army, and entred <hi>London,</hi> and when he purpoſed to have forced the Queen, his Forces ran away from him, and he was taken priſoner, accuſed of High-Treaſon, and loſt his Head for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles Blunt</hi> was ſent in his place, who in divers fights wonderfully ſubdued the Forces of the Rebels, though the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had ſent many ſupplies to relieve them; In a ſet Battle he overthrew <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and the <hi>Auxiliary Spaniards,</hi> and then made Conditions, driving them out of <hi>Ireland. Tyrone</hi> afterwards when he tried all wayes, ſubmitted, and humbly intreated the Queens Pardon. In the mean time <hi>Richard Leviſon</hi> and <hi>William Monſon,</hi> with eight great Ships, and ſome ſmall ones, went and ſpoiled the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Coaſts, and meeting the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Fleet coming from <hi>America</hi> with abundance of wealth, he ſet upon them, but was too weak for them, for he was diſappointed. After that he maſtered a very great rich Ship riding at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and burning ſome leſſer Ships, he returned for <hi>England</hi> with her.</p>
               <p>At that time the Seminaries of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and chiefly the Jeſuites were baniſhed out of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe they cauſed croubles, and could not live quietly.</p>

               <p>At laſt the Queen being feeble with age and hot diſeaſe, ſhe died in the year 1602. and ſhe departed a very good Chriſtian, having named King <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> Sonne to <hi>Mary Stuart</hi> to be her Succeſſour, when ſhe had raigned fourty four years and four Moneths, A Queen that was moſt endowed with all the Benefits of Nature, a comely Perſon, for her Body, but more comely in her Soul, ſhe was an excellent Scholar, to be commended for her Goodneſſe and Juſtice, She was a Mother to her Subjects, and a Subject to the Laws.</p>

He was a King the more happy, becauſe he obtain'd a Kingdom by lawfull ſucceſſion, that was no wayes embroyled with Warres and Tumults, but ſetled in exceeding great Peace. But as in the calmeſt weather ofttimes clouds riſe ſuddenly, and it fals to thundering and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſo the affairs of <hi>Brittany,</hi> though moſt peaceably, were endangered by the malice and conſpiracy of ſome.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:119698:121"/>this flame vaniſhed into ſmoke, the principall being either put to death, or condemned to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual impriſonment, or having their pardons granted to them.

               <p>Though Peace were ſettled abroad, yet there was occaſion for new Troubles at home; For when the King had called a Parliament, a very horrible Conſpiracy was detected, the chief Authour of it was one <hi>Cateſby</hi> a <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;</hi> He having hamper'd ſome other men in the ſame buſineſs, endeavoured at one ſtroke to root out all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, as it were by Lightning from Heaven. For hiring a Cellar under the Parliament-Houſe, be laid in a vaſt deal of Gun-pouder, which he purpoſed to ſet fire to, and ſo to blow up at once all the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Houſe, together with the King, the Prince and all the Nobility; but the matter was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the importunate care of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who gave warning of the danger to the Lord <hi>Mounteagle,</hi> Sonne to the Lord <hi>Morlay,</hi> a Member of the Parliament, and one that they loved very well. In this Vault there were found terrible Inſtruments of this damned wickedneſs, that a man would wonder at, which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:119698:121"/>taken away.

               <p>CHARLES the firſt ſucceeded his Father, being twenty five yeares of age. The firſt deſign he had was to marry <hi>Henrietta Mary,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth King of <hi>France,</hi> as he purpoſed before, who landed in <hi>England</hi> the 22 day of <hi>April,</hi> and was received magnificently.</p>
               <p>Then a Navy was prepared againſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> (for all friendſhip was grown ſtale be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Kings, by reaſon of the breach of the Marriage, and the buſineſs of the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate</hi>) he joyned with the Ships of <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſent away toward <hi>Spain,</hi> and firſt aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Cades</hi> and not prevailing, they ſet up ſail to Sea, and ſpoyling all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Veſſels they met, they return for <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now a Covenant was made between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the United Provinces, and they reſolved with joynt Forces to tire out the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiard,</hi> but <hi>Charles,</hi> whoſe Exchequer was empted by reaſon of his great Expence of his

                  <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Voyage, and ſetting forth of his Navy, was forced to call a Parliament, but <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the Kings chief Miniſter of State, and moſt dear unto him, had yet given no anſwer to his Charge, whereupon they denied to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the King with Subſidies, wherefore he was forced to finde out ſome other waies to raiſe monies, wherewith he provided a mighty Fleet once more, wherewith, aſſiſted by the <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Ships, he ſpoiled all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships they met, either coming from <hi>Spain,</hi> or ſailing thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and did wonderfully annoy the very <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Coaſts; but when the <hi>French</hi> were not ſpared, a ſtop was made in <hi>France</hi> of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels, and the Merchants Goods were Confiſcate. The Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had heightned the indignation, thoſe that came into <hi>England</hi> with the Queen, and theſe did what they could privately to trouble the <hi>Engliſh</hi> affairs. They were commanded to leave the Land, but they were ſent away with good gifts and rewards. The <hi>French</hi> offended at this as an injury, ſent Monſier <hi>Baſſempeir</hi> Extraordinary Embaſſadour into <hi>England,</hi> who prevailed ſo farre that ſome were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> was not ſatisfied with this, but forbad all Commerce with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubjects, and <hi>Charles</hi> did the like. Envy increaſing,

                  <hi>Lewis</hi> oppreſſed the <hi>Rochellers; Charles</hi> ſent relief to the beſieged, though he prevailed but little, ſome mens hearts flagging, who returned for <hi>England,</hi> and for their ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they were caſt into priſon. But chiefly ſharp complaints were charged by the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of this Expedition: <hi>That he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſome Sea Towns to the Cuſtody of ſome Souldiers that received no pay from the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>and had made ſtrangers Commanders of them in Chief. That to the great detriment and hazard of the Kingdom, he had brought</hi> German <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers into</hi> England. <hi>That by his perſwaſion one Parliament was called after another and nothing done. That he had put many worthy Noble man from their places undeſervedly, and put men leſs deſerving into their places. That Warlick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions undertaken imprudently had alwaies an ill end, as was freſh in memory by the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell <hi>buſineſs. That Merchandiſe failed by this means. That he had turned another way ſuch preparations as were made for Warre, and had deſtroyed a multitude of Shipping by his ill mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of buſineſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> to ſtop all farther proceedings againſt <hi>Buckingham,</hi> preſently diſſolved the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and being overcome with the continuall prayers of the beſieged, he raiſed new Forces
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:119698:125"/>to ſend to aſſiſt the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> but when he was ready to Embarque himſelf, he was ſtabbed with a Knife by <hi>Felton</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man (who by this act did ſacrifice himſelf for his Country) but he was taken when he had done it, and was hanged for his pains.</p>
               <p>Then a new Parliament was ſummoned; the King complained that Tunnage was denied him, the anſwer was made that ſuch ſupplies were never granted to the Kings but upon urgent neceſſity, and therefore it were better that he ſhould look to prevent the wrongs that were every where crept in, whereupon the Parliament was once more Diſſolved.</p>
               <p>Then there was a <hi>ſuperſedeas</hi> to all buſineſs, for if any man did not pay that Cuſtom he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the Kings diſpleaſure, and if any did pay, then he incurred the diſpleaſure of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hereupon grew cauſe enough for following miſchiefs. The King offended at the mallepartneſs of the Parliament, caſt S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Eliot</hi> and ſome other Members of Parliament into priſon, and appointed Judges to take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of their Fact, they ſuppoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves choſen beſides the cuſtom, deferred to meddle with the buſineſs, being doubtfull what to do, the King preſſed them on one hand, and the people on the other. The Kings Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:119698:126"/>ſent meſſengers to the Merchants, whom they call uſually Adventurers, exhorting them that they would ſet their Merchandiſe to ſale, as they were wont, ſaying the King would take care of all, only let them pay their Cuſtom, which thing they refuſed to do, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Parliament.</p>
               <p>The other Merchants did the ſame, for it was freſh in their memories, that about an hundred years before, the Merchants had a penalty ſet upon them, who paid their Cuſtom, the Parliament being againſt it, in memoriall whereof, that poſterity might not plead igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, a Chappel was built, which at this day is called <hi>Alderman-Bury;</hi> and a ſtranger Merchant, who paying the Cuſtom, had ſet his Merchandize to ſale, was excluded from all Commerce. And for this reaſon there was cauſe given for both ſides to be diſpleaſed. In the <hi>interim</hi> Peace was ratified with <hi>France,</hi> and the Queen was brought a Bed of her firſt-born <hi>Charles.</hi> The <hi>Spaniard</hi> alſo was hampred with divers Warres, and want of moneys, and therefore he thought it better to make Peace with <hi>Charles,</hi> than to be brought to a finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparation, yet the King and his ſubjects were never the better agreed.</p>
               <p>New and greater cauſes of diſſention aroſe: The King had taken care that the Book of

This form was read in Churches and Houſes at that time through all <hi>England.</hi> But the <hi>Scotch,</hi> a ſcrupulous people in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who are more afraid of the, name of <hi>yielding,</hi> than <hi>reſiſting,</hi> and would ſooner <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt Religion</hi> than <hi>the Ceremonies of it,</hi> did publickly refuſe it, but they eſpecially, who held forth affected purity, were called Puritans.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> to regulate the obſtinate, preſently muſters an Army to invade <hi>Scotland. James Hamilton</hi> was the cauſe of it, who was ſent into <hi>Scotland</hi> to allay the peoples mindes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould come to a Warre, but he dealt deceitfully, for having a deſire to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he endeavoured to raiſe diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and hoped to fiſh beſt in troubled waters. The <hi>Scotch</hi> on the other part, that they might not idly wait for their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, meet the King with their Forces, but their Banners and Enſignes were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaied, and in token of humility they laid their Arms down before him on the ground. But when both Armies ſtood now ready, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> that they might not ſtrive with their
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:119698:127"/>Brethren, refuſed to fight, wherefore he was forced to make peace with the <hi>Scots</hi> upon no good conditions, which being ratified, he came back to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was ſcarce returned, but ſome factious fellows, and ſuch as by troubles and Warre hoped to make their own advantage, ſpeak againſt the Kings ſluggiſhneſs, and ſtirred him up; who was already prone enough to make a new Warre againſt the <hi>Scots;</hi> whereupon he goes once more with an Army into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by the ſame contumacy of his ſouldiers, as before, he was fruſtrate of his intentions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scotch</hi> alſo made a nearer agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves againſt the King, which they called their [Covenant.] The King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he was diſtreſſed for want, cals a Parliament, and asks Subſidies of them, but it was in vain, wherefore he was forced to fly to other Artifices. The Queen that was preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the ſame care the King was, dealt with the Earl <hi>Charles Roſſet,</hi> and with other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the <hi>Barbarians, Panſanius</hi> and <hi>Cuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> to procure a ſupply out of the Popes Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury (yet it is ſuppoſed that the King knew nothing of it) promiſing if ſhe prevailed, that the Catholicks in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould have greater liberty in their Religion. But <hi>Roſſet</hi> denied that any ſuch aſſiſtance could be granted to any,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:119698:127"/>unleſs to a Catholick Prince, (as they term it) but if the King would abjure the Reformed Religion, and cleave to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he promiſed all aſſiſtance; but he hating ſuch a ſacriledge, nothing was done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſſet</hi> for this buſineſs was in great danger; for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who after they had renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, hated his name more than the Plague, or death it ſelf, when they ſaw that his followers had more freedom, and were not ignorant of <hi>Roſſet,</hi> who was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, they make a tumultuous head againſt him, that they might tear in pieces this hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full inſtrument of ſo hatefull ſuperſtition; but he hardly eſcaping in diſguiſed apparell, hid himſelf amongſt the friends of the Queen Mother, <hi>Mary de Medicis,</hi> who at that time was in <hi>England,</hi> and afterwards he eſcaped all danger, by the aſſiſtance of <hi>John Juſtinian</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſadour, and Embarking himſelf he ſailed into <hi>Flanders;</hi> but when he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> Pope <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the eighth rewarded his good ſervice with a Cardinals Cap.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> in the <hi>interim</hi> were broke forth into a new Rebellion, and the Parliament uſed all means to finde a remedy for ſuch a miſchief. And the King being not at quiet, cauſed the Liturgy to be new printed, which
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:119698:128"/>he impoſed upon all the Churches in <hi>England,</hi> and forbad all Ceremonies to be uſed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than they were in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> daies. In the mean while, that no new cauſe of diviſions might be wanting, ſeven <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts are caſt into priſon, and are condemned by the Parliament to ſuffer death; but the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour pitied their miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſued to the King for their pardon, the King anſwered he could grant nothing in that buſineſs, without conſent from his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Then it was motioned to the Parliament who preſently yielded to it. The King when he knew this, thought by an importunate anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation to gain the thanks of that buſineſs to himſelf, and of his own accord commands the Prieſts to be freed from the priſon. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was angry at the Kings over-forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and changed their former Decree of freedom into a Sentence of condemnation: The King he began to urge their diſcharge, and to ſtand upon it, reſolving never to leave the buſineſs untill the Parliament were met in a full number, and ſhould give their finall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. They of their own accord cauſe one or two of theſe Monks to be put to death. It is wonderfull how great good will of the people they procured to themſelves by this deed, eſpecially when by their publick Writings
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:119698:128"/>they began to infringe the Kings Authority, uſing ſuch ſweet words to the people, that might win their good liking of it. The King in the Houſe of Peers complains of the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Lower Houſe, and by a ſharp Speech inveighed againſt their ſtubborneſs, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he neither could nor would wink at ſo great affronts. Others again complain againſt the Kings too great Power, and deſire remedies.</p>
               <p>The King in the mean time ſtrove to put out ſome from their places of publick employment, and to put in others; amongſt the reſt, he put out <hi>Montjoy</hi> from his Lieutenants place of the Tower, and put in another that ſtood faſt to his part. The Lower Houſe interprets this buſineſs, as if the King ſtrove to draw all the power of Government to himſelf, and accuſed this new Lieutenant before the Upper Houſe, for a factious perſon, and who was before condemned by the Judges to dye, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man unfit for ſo weighty an imployment. They added farther that this matter could not be without danger, for he having the command of the Tower might deſtroy all the City of <hi>London.</hi> The Upper Houſe anſwered, <hi>That unleſs they would put their ſickle into another mans Corn, it were wickedneſs in them to hinder the King in that matter, for it was an ancient
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:119698:129"/>and received prerogative of the Kings,</hi> openly refuſing their conſent.</p>
               <p>Nor was it long ere a multitude of Servants (which they call Apprentices) and a rabble of other people, came to the Hall door, crying out and thundring, that unleſs they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move out of that place the Lieutenant of the Tower, who was a Papiſt, a factious, a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unworthy man, they would turn all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down; and they prevailed by this means ſo far, that both the King and the Lords were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to conſent.</p>
               <p>Nor was this furious multitude of the people content with this, but they made a freſh onſet to aboliſh the Government of Biſhops, and would have them all to be forwarnd the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Houſe, for that they were addicted (as they pretended) to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to force them to it, they runne like furies into <hi>Weſtminster</hi> Abbey, that was venerable for it's Antiquity, and they fall in their rage upon the ſacred Garments, Organs, Sepulchres, and ſpoil all that was either comely for its Ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pretious for coſt, or to be valued for curious Workmanſhip; they hardly ſpared the Bones and Aſhes of the dead, their impure purity had hurried them ſo farre. Then they runne to the Kings Court, crying, urging and thundring out the ſame things. The King had

The Parliament either fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves (or becauſe they would not be inferiour to the King) require a ſtrong Guard of Souldiers to defend them, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> might be the Captain of it. The King neither granted nor denied it. Then they attempted a new buſineſs, and that was not uſual, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an extraordinary Aſſembly in the City, that ſhould manage all weighty and great occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and this they did, without the Kings leave or knowledge. And to weaken his Majeſty the more, or rather to ſatisfie the inſolence of the people, they caſt twelve Biſhops into priſon, becauſe they went about to maintain their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge by the publick Charter. That buſineſs much troubled the King, and all thoſe that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the publick quiet above all things, but they that hoped to finde ſome good for themſelves out of theſe toſſings and tumults, did laugh in their ſleeves, fomenting the troubles, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every ſtone, untill ſuch time as the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> and his ſonne were involved in the ſame danger (<hi>Strafford</hi> the year before loſt his Head to ſatisfie the people, who was a man of a commendable and moſt approved underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)

                  <hi>William Laud</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Primate of <hi>England</hi> followed him. But now they touched his bowels, for they began to accuſe the Queens Majeſty, as if ſhe had privately cauſed the troubles in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had ſecretly moved that people (that are of themſelves inconſtant enough) to rebell. The King moved with this, accuſed five of the Lower Houſe, and one of the Upper Houſe of High Treaſon. Their Names were, the Lord Viſcount <hi>Mandevill,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>The Articles of their accuſation were theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they endeavoured to overthrow the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws, and the Kings Authority.</hi>

               <p>Theſe Articles being read to the Lower-Houſe, the King required that ſome ſhould be ſent to ſeize preſently on their Writings, but ſome were ſent to the King to diſſwade him from it, and in the name of the Parliament, they would be Surety for the fidelity of the Members accuſed. But the King anſwered, That he required Obedience from his Subjects without enquiring into his Reaſons. Others again urged, That the King by this Act had overthrown the Priviledges of Parliament, and noted this Accuſation to be a famous Libel.</p>
               <p>The King was reſolved to oppoſe Force againſt Force, he requires aſſiſtance from the Souldiery, and haſteneth to the Hall with five hundred armed men after him, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all to wait at the door, he only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Houſe with an angry Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and when he ſaw none of thoſe that were accuſed, he ſeriouſly relates his good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to the Parliament, and to the Laws and Priviledges thereof, requiring that thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers he accuſed might be delivered up to him, and ſo he went back to his Palace the ſame way as he came, and ſent a Herauld once more to finde out thoſe he had charged. Then he goes
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:119698:131"/>again himſelf to the Houſe, where the reſt of the Members late, and did renew his diſcourſe, whereby he expreſſed his good Inclination, and laboured to remove the envy from himſelf, that lay upon him, ſaying, That he would change nothing, nor do otherwiſe than what was done in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes; Then he went to Dinner to one of the Sheriffs houſes, and was in ſome danger by reaſon of the enraged mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. But the Lower-Houſe taking Counſell with the Upper, reſolved by all means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge this rigour of the King that he had uſed againſt their Priviledges, they preſently put the City in Arms, cauſed them to ſhut up their Shops, and the ſitting was adjourned for five dayes. Alſo the Parliament for bad the Citizens, that no man ſhould help the King to finde out thoſe that were accuſed, rendring the King as hatefull to the People as they could, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Authority. The King, when he might have made uſe of this Diviſion between the two Houſes to overthrow the attempts of the People, breaks forth into violent anger, ſets a. Guard upon the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and once more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the accuſed to be guilty of High Treaſon, forbidding all men either to conceal them, or to convey them away, promiſing their Eſtates to any that ſhould diſcover them, either alive or dead. But men were ſo farre from obeying the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:119698:131"/>King, that the accuſed Members, guarded with a multitude of Citizens, took their places again, as before in Parliament, yet this was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, for the Parliament publiſhed through the City, That the King intended to ruine the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, That his Forces were now ready to do it, which did not a little exaſperate the mindes of the Citizens. But the Aldermen of the City took a better courſe, and humbly certified the King, That the Communalty were too much incenſed already, and therefore he ſhould let paſs bitter counſel, and finde out ſome way to compoſe the matter. The King anſwered them with the greateſt moderation, greatly complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his Authority was violated.</p>
               <p>But the Parliament, when they had brought the buſineſs ſo farre, thought not fit to give it over, but on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>January,</hi> in the Year 1642. raiſed a vaſt multitude of Citizens, and others, as it was pretended, to defend the Houſes, that they might aſſemble freely, and Latters were forthwith ſent to other neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Counties, whereby they were commanded to draw up in Arms all the Forces they could, under colour to defend the Laws and Liberties: Upon this occaſion there came together a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Army, ſo that at leaſt 20000 were ready at a beck.</p>
               <p>The King having timely notice of it, leaving
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:119698:132"/>the City, makes haſte to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Counſellours to follow him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Earls of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> but they refuſed, wherefore the King with a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, took his journey like one that fled, ſo that for haſte, being he had no Purveyors, to provide room for him ſufficiently, He, his Wife and Children the firſt night, were conſtrained to tumble all in one Bed.</p>
               <p>He being now eſcaped from out of their hands, by Proclamations endeavoured to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his own Cauſe before the whole world, but he wanted help.</p>
               <p>It was otherwiſe with the Parliament, for all <hi>London</hi> now ſtood againſt the King, ready in Arms. The Streets and croſſe-wayes were ſtopped with Chains, and Barres, and Cannon mounted; Alſo the Parliaments Forces were augmented by an addition of four thouſand Horſe Souldiers that came to them. The Boats and Barks were fitted for the Warre, and moſt of the Citizens ſervants and Apprentices, were at a call to joyn with the Parliament, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armed what with Clubs, what with Sticks, what with Swords, and other Weapons, they came and guarded the Parliament-Houſe, at Halberd-men; And from that time the meeting was not at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as before, but in the City, that they might the better win the minds
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:119698:132"/>of the Citizens to themſelves, and be nearer to their buſineſſe. Though the King being asked his opinion thereof by <hi>Eſſex,</hi> did flatly deny it, wherefore they are reſolved to ſet upon the Kings ſtubborn minde (as they ſaid.) They commanded the Governours of Sea-Towns, not to obey the Kings Orders, unleſs they were confirmed by the Authority and Seal of the Parliament, at one blow almoſt cutting off all the Kings Authority. This might have been prevented, had he by good counſell taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of thoſe Towns, and put in Souldiers to keep them for him.</p>
               <p>The King, when he ſaw they provided Force, and that he was not ſafe at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, rides preſently to <hi>Windſor,</hi> thither came the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour to him, who offered to be Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire between the King and his Subjects, but when neither King nor Queen would give any great credit to his words, he did prevail but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. But now the King firſt ſaw that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of his hopes, when he imagined that <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Yorkshire</hi> were revolted from him, at the Report of what was paſt, and for fear of them his counſel was troubled.</p>
               <p>But the Parliament (which the King in his ſtraights was not ignorant of) thought fit to proceed, and did preſcribe Conditions to the King, namely, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould be
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:119698:133"/>governed the ſame way as the <hi>Scotch</hi> were, and to that they might call a Parliament as often as they pleaſed, and aſſign Offices to whom they thought fit, That the Biſhops ſhould be ejected out of the Parliament, whom they found more addicted to the Kings ſide, and many ſuch like Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Houſes take into their Power the Towns of greateſt concernment, amongſt which <hi>Hull</hi> was one; The King had ſent the Earl of <hi>New-caſtle</hi> thither before to demand it for himſelf, but the Townſmen, who had firſt received order from the Parliament, being doubtfull what to do, were between hope and fear, but then being confirmed with a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order from the Parliament, they excluded the King. Wherefore being defrauded of his hope, he reſolves upon more milde counſels, and ſent Letters to the two Houſes, deſiring them not to proceed ſo harſhly, to leave off their violence, proteſting his Innocence and ſincere intention before God and man. But the Parliament little moved by theſe words, take care in the mean time for the buſineſs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> giving Licence to <hi>Martin Tromp</hi> the Admiral of <hi>Holland</hi> to ſearch all <hi>Dunkirk</hi> ſhips, even in they very <hi>Engliſh</hi> Havens. Alſo <hi>Digby</hi> and <hi>Lunsford</hi> that were addicted to the King, are accuſed of High Treaſon, the one was taken,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:119698:133"/>the other eſcaped into <hi>Holland.</hi> Then they ſend Meſſengers to the King, and gave him thanks for his Letters, deſiring his Majeſty to return to <hi>London.</hi> The King, though he were pleaſed with their gratitude, yet refuſed to come to the Parliament, leaſt the people by their Inſolence ſhould again put him in danger. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was much diſpleaſed with this refuſall of the King, becauſe the traffique did not proceed well, and becauſe they could not preſs their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns as they would. Whereupon the Lower Houſe drew up an Humble Remonſtrance, <hi>Whereby they deſired Power to beſtow all Places of Government both by Sea and Land, upon whom they thought fit, and to fortifie Towns with Ammunition and Proviſion neceſſary, as they pleaſed.</hi> And proceeding yet farther, <hi>They asked that the old Servants of the Queen, both Engliſh and French, and ſuch as were her Prieſts might be baniſhed, and the Biſhops and Lords addicted to the Popiſh Religion, might be excluded from the Parliament-Houſe. That a Synod of fifty Miniſters might be called. That the Princes and Lords ſhould be forbidden to go out of the Land, or to make any Covenant with forrain Princes or Commonwealths, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Parliaments conſent.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that the King ſhould take an Oath to hold no counſel with the Queen in Church or State affairs.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:119698:134"/>
               <p>The Lords of the Upper Houſe were not well pleaſed with theſe Propoſitions, for that the Kings Authority was palpably infringed by them. The Lower Houſe was angry at that, and fell to their former Artifice, and threatned to raiſe the people, and incite them againſt the Nobility, as Enemies to the Commonwealth, and addicted to the Kings ſide. The Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not their threats, untill they ſaw the Commons uniting themſelves by counſel from the Lower Houſe, and (which is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired) they found the Commiſſioners of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to joyn with them againſt the profit of their own Countrey. At laſt they were terrified with theſe things, and fore-ſeeing greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, they conſent, though it were againſt their wils. Twenty choſen men therefore are ſent to the King with theſe Conditions, which when the King beheld, he undertook to ask Counſell thereupon, and to deliver his minde in writing. But when he was preſſed with ſtraights on all ſides, he yielded to theſe Conditions, namely, <hi>That the Parliament ſhould ſtore the Cities of the Kingdom with proviſion, upon this ground that the King ſhould firſt be made acquainted what proviſion they would make, and to beſtow the Offices, ſo that of three men choſen, the King might chooſe one. As for the Biſhops and the reſt, as being matters of great moment, he
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:119698:134"/>would adviſe farther.</hi> The Kings Conſent was received by the Parliament with great applauſe, though they could have deſired the terms of his Grant had been larger, for by this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they increaſed in power as much as the King decreaſed. They brought the buſineſs ſo farre, that the power ſhould be in their hands ſo long as the Parliament ſate, which they meant for ever: For the King by a dangerous Indulgence, had granted them leave before to ſit ſo long as they pleaſed, they being not to be diſſolved without their own Conſent. And that this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er granted to them might not prove unfruitfull, they preſently put out ſome Governours, and put in others. Nor are they content with this, but being higher by the Kings Grants, they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition that the ſix Members ſhould be cleared from all guilt, and to be freed from attainder, the King was reſolved to yield to all, and did grant what they asked.</p>
               <p>The Kings courage was ſo farre weakned, that he lifted up the Power of his Adverſaries, and pulled down the hopes of his friends, who truſting but little to his over great lenity, thought it beſt to avoid the ſtrokes or misfortune now hanging over their heads, Part of them forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Parliament, went home to their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; Part of them preferring voluntary baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before continual fear, went out of the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:119698:135"/>Land, for they had now got the power of all into their hands, and did what they pleaſed, no man daring to whiſper againſt it.</p>
               <p>And now that plenty of Parliament-members was ſo diminiſhed, that in the Upper Houſe there were left not above five and twenty, in the Lower Houſe ſcarce fourſcore, the Kings friends ſtill falling off, that at laſt there were hardly ſixteen in the Houſe of Lords. In the mean time they raged fiercely againſt thoſe that were addicted to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and they provide a Fleet with the Kings Treaſure, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Mediterranean Sea upon all occaſions, whereby his Power was diminiſhed, and his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority broken. The Queen alſo was ſo tired out with ſo many calumnies and aſperſions, that ſhe reſolved to ſail into <hi>Holland,</hi> and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her Daughter to her Husband the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to whom ſhe was eſpouſed. And the Parliament to leave the King naked of that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour eaſily yielded to it. The King that he might clearly demonſtrate that he by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence had been no cauſe of any of thoſe evils, before his departure had conſented to the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Parliament, to exclude the Biſhops out of the Houſe, (which was not the leaſt of his failings) And to diſcover his minde plainly toward the Reformed Religion, he cauſed a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Statute to be publiſhed againſt the Papiſts,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:119698:135"/>and baniſhed all their Prieſts out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 'Tis marvellous with how great joy the people accepted that, Bonfires were made in triumph at <hi>London,</hi> and in other places, it may be it was done, becauſe the Kings Power was now ended.</p>
               <p>The Queen in the mean time imbarqued at <hi>Dover,</hi> and with true tears took her laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, fore-ſeeing that this departure of hers was an <hi>omen</hi> of a moſt ſad Divorce.</p>
               <p>The Parliament in the <hi>interim</hi> asked the Kings conſent upon ſome Governours of the Kingdom they had choſen. But the King who was now ſenſible of his errours, began to draw back, and to delay the buſineſs. They impatient of all delayes, ſend Commiſſioners to him, to let him underſtand, <hi>That the Parliament muſt flie to their Arms, and defend their Authority by force, unleſſe the King would preſently grant their juſt Petitions,</hi> (as they ſaid.) And when the King reſolved to remove farther from <hi>London,</hi> they entreated him not to do it, but rather if he would not, he ſhould let his Sonne live at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> The King not wondring a little at this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, anſwered, <hi>That he was by theſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions much amazed, but what to anſwer he knew not. He would have them lay their hands on their hearts, and would ſearch whether of the two gave the cauſe now of miſchiefs that would ariſe from a
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:119698:136"/>Civil Warre. As for his Sonne, he would as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provide for him, and that neither of them would go from London, unleſs they were afraid of the Inſolency of ſome people there. And that he deſired to procure Peace by all means, not caring who took up Arms, for he would reſt on Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi> So their Meſſengers were diſmiſſed.</p>
               <p>But the Parliament, ſuppoſing they were not now to demur, command all the Lieutenants of the Counties by their Edicts, to flie to their Arms, and to compell all their Subjects that were fit to bear Arms to repair to their Colours. And forthwith they unpoured all thoſe Officers the King had made, and made new ones by their own Authority. The moſt excellent and the wiſeſt men were of opinion, that all that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Parliament would diſſolve into ſmoke The <hi>London</hi> Counſel alſo thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wronged by this unuſual and unheard of boldneſs in the Parliament, for by this means they were ſtript of all their Authority. They complain of it to the King, but what ſhould he do, whoſe hands were already bound, and he did not ſtrive to unbinde them. Then they put up their humble Petitions to the Parliament, to which the principal Citizens of <hi>London</hi> ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed their hands.</p>
               <p>But when they waited for an Anſwer, as it was requiſite, the principal of the Subſcribers were
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:119698:136"/>puniſhed. So all things grew worſe and worſe. The King in the mean time, who was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Parliament Attempts, called all his Nobility to him, that he might put a ſtop to the Parliament proceedings; The Parliament to lull the King aſleep with fair words, uſed all devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and when this would not do, they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh him with complaints and crimes, <hi>As that he had hearkned to a change in Religion, and given cauſe for the uprears in Ireland, eſpecially they that were most powerfull with him, ſecretly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotting the Queen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They added, That the Inſtruments of the Pope, of the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> were reſolved to reſtore the King to his former Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and other things that ſerved to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie their own proceedings, and to make the King faulty.</p>
               <p>The King publiſhed his Declarations, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to remove theſe aſperſions from him, and to decline the hatred of them, yet prevailed nothing, for the Parliament by a new Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, did both ſupport and augmented the former Articles, complaining that the greateſt injury was done to themſelves by the Kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking them.</p>
               <p>The King in the mean time takes his journey for <hi>York,</hi> together with the Prince, the Palſgrave, the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and ſome other of the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:119698:137"/>Nobility, being reſolved to be deluded no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to oppoſe Force againſt Force, and the Right he could not maintain by yielding, to maintain by Arms.</p>
               <p>The Parliament did not ſit ſtill, but fortified the chief Towns with Ammunition and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, eſpecially <hi>Hull,</hi> a City of greateſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> was ſent with thirty men of Warre, to guard the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſts, and they call Vice-Admiral <hi>Pennington</hi> back again by ſpeedy Meſſengers, who had tranſported the Queen into <hi>Holland,</hi> and under pretence of ſubduing Rebellion, they gather a mighty maſs of money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> in the mean time to overthrow their Commands, prohibits what they would have by Edicts to the contrary; but they diſobeying the King, did their work by frighting him with threats, which was a great grief to moderate men.</p>
               <p>The King when he was come to <hi>York,</hi> was received with the higheſt affection of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and before them all he removeth all that envy of Popery that was charged upon him.</p>
               <p>But the Parliament, who were not well pleaſed with the <hi>Yorkshire</hi> men for this, ſent Letters to the King, inſerting fair ſpeeches, to pacifie his anger. They write a counterfeit Letter in the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:119698:137"/>name of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Counteſs <hi>Palatine,</hi> as writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by her, wherein they did foully defame the States of <hi>Holland</hi> for her ill entertainment amongſt them. To avoid the hatred of this buſineſs, <hi>Joachimus,</hi> the States Embaſſadour, complained to the Parliament of the falſity of that report, becauſe his Maſters Honours were much ſhadowed by it, whoſe ſplendor and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence toward ſtrangers, was ſufficiently known to all the world; and he prevailed ſo farre that theſe counterfeit Letters were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly burnt.</p>
               <p>A Rumour alſo as falſe as the former was ſcattered abroad, that a great Fleet was made ready for King <hi>Charles</hi> in the <hi>Denmark</hi> Havens, and thus each on both ſides ſtrive to draw re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and authority to their party. They had long enough banded in words, they muſt now come to blows. Ere long they break forth into open Warre. The King cals all the Knights of the Garter, and all others that by the band of Nobility held from the Crown, to come to him to <hi>York.</hi> The Parliament contrarily made it death for any of them to go to the King, yet of the Lower Houſe twenty Members re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt to the King, making more reckoning of the Kings commands than of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>In the mean time there followed an humble
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:119698:138"/>Petition of the men of <hi>Kent,</hi> to the Parliament, wherein they humbly deſired,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That nothing ſhould be done without the Kings conſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Liturgy might not be altered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Biſhops might be reſtored.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they would not ſuffer the Fundamentall Laws of the Land to be antiquated without the Kings permiſſion, nor Arms to be raiſed without his command.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſome good means might be found out to make an agreement,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But the Parliament not only denied to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them, but they ſeverely puniſh him that brought the Petition, and the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> that received it, caſting both of them into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to cut off for the future all way for ſuch requeſts, their fellows not a little raging at it, and ſaying openly that that liberty was unjuſtly taken away, whenas they had liſtned to other Petitions that were farre more unequall than that was.</p>
               <p>The Parliament in the mean time, when they found nothing done by the Commiſſioners they had ſent to the King, reſolve to execute their former commands, they command the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of Counties to perform what they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had enjoyned them, and preſently to raiſe ſuch an Army, who willingly went about
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:119698:138"/>it, hoping from troubles to finde occaſion to do their buſineſs, yet ſome looking deeper into it, refuſed to raiſe Arms without the Kings Order.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Houſes purpoſed to remove <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington</hi> that was come back again, becauſe they found him more enclined to the King than to the Parliament, but he denied to yield to them unleſs the King ſhould force him to it. The King truſting to his fidelity, refuſed to diſcharge him, and to receive <hi>Warwick</hi> whom they would ſubſtitute. But the Lower Houſe (the Upper Houſe being againſt it, who held it unfit to proceed without the Kings conſent) preſſed the buſineſs, and confirmed the firſt Election, and being exaſperated by the Kings inclination, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſeriouſly for to make a Warre of it. All the proviſion of <hi>Hull</hi> or other Garriſons, they commanded to be brought to <hi>London,</hi> fearing leaſt the King ſhould at ſome time poſſeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Town and Ammunition: But they to whoſe truſt theſe things were committed, would not deliver them without command from the King. They valued not all their threats and commands to have the Governour of the Town delivered up unto them.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the <hi>Sommerſetſhire</hi> men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting the obſtinacy of the Parliament, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Men of <hi>Kent,</hi> preſented an humble
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:119698:139"/>Petition to the Parliament; but they offended with their boldneſs, command it to be burned by the Hangman, to deterre the <hi>Sommerſetſhire</hi> men from profering any more ſuch Petitions, who were charged to come in no greater mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes than was requiſite.</p>
               <p>The King alſo deſired to ſail into <hi>Ireland</hi> with a ſufficient Army to tame the Rebels. But the Houſes fearing leaſt he ſhould allure the Rebels to joyn with him, and being ſtrengthened with their Forces, ſhould return for <hi>England,</hi> denied him his requeſt, and preferred their own fears before the relief of ſo many miſerable men. He in the mean time depoſed the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> from being Chamberlain, and <hi>Leiceſter</hi> from being Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> for their diſobedience. But the Houſes on the contrary forbid all of them to do any ſuch thing without their prohibition, on penalty of their lives; alſo they confirmed <hi>Warwicks</hi> Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And that they might fortifie the mindes of all men the more, and exaſperate them againſt the King, they ſpread a report, that there was a great proviſion made by him for Warre againſt the Commonwealth and the Laws, ſaying that all the ſubjects were therefore freed from their Oaths. The King holds forth the contrary in his Declarations: And when ſome <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> men came to him in Troops, and offered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:119698:139"/>the Kings Cauſe, he forbad them ſtifly; and to manifeſt to all his love of Peace, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them all to go home again, upon the condition that they ſhould return to aſſiſt him when they were called. He detained only 500 Foot, and 50 Horſe for his Life-Guard. Many of the Nobility were drawn by this lenity of the King to revolt to him. The Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, that had done him ſo many injuries, asking pardon of the King, was friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received by him. This was the cauſe that many others fell away, ſo that in the Upper Houſe there remained not above fifteen, and they the moſt bitter againſt him. Theſe with new repreſentations concerning the Education of his Children, the Offices of the Kingdom, and ſuch like queſtions wearied the Kings minde. But they prevailed nothing, for thoſe Captains and Souldiers that were muſtered againſt the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> leaving their Colours freely, fled to the King at <hi>York:</hi> Whereupon the King augmented his Life-Guard to 1200 Foot, and 200 Horſe, all deſcended of Noble Families, and for the greater Honour to them, he made the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> their Captain. Theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required to manifeſt their fidelity, did all ſwear unanimouſly to defend the Kings Cauſe, but all the Nobility offered willingly to raiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:119698:140"/>By which conſtancy of the ſubject, and by a ſmall ſumme of money he received out of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the King began to be cheered with new hopes.</p>
               <p>Then he appointed the <hi>Yorkshire</hi> men to meet him at a certain place, on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>June,</hi> not farre from <hi>York,</hi> who according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came with about 60000. The King with his Sonne, ſome Lords, 600 Horſe, and a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable party of Foot, met them there, and with a premeditated Speech, he declared his good intention toward Religion, the Parliament, and to defend his own Rights and Kingly Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Alſo he made an Apology for the good of his Souldiers that were preſent; then he ſhewed unto them the Acts of Parliament. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he promiſed good pay, if any man would aſſiſt him, becauſe he deſired to uſe the help of his ſubjects rather than ſtrangers. This Speech was received by ſome with great applauſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers made their humble Petition that the King would hold a good correſpondency with his Parliament, and deſired that he would ſend thoſe Lords back to the Parliament who had revolted from them. But the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> the Kings Chamberlane, and <hi>Lovel</hi> foreſeeing the diſſention might riſe from this Petition, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed this faction at the beginning. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> they were diſpleaſed, and divers men went
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:119698:140"/>away from the King. But the King accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with twenty thouſand men came to <hi>York,</hi> and commanded them all to return to their houſes.</p>
               <p>The Parliament was not ignorant of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, they accuſe the ſaid Lords of Treaſon, becauſe they had hindred the ſubjects from Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning freely for relief of their grievances, not remembring what example they had given by refuſing the Petitions of the Men of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Sommerſetſhire,</hi> and not only ſo, but had ſeverely puniſhed them for offering their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions.</p>
               <p>Then they raiſed an Army of 10000 Foot, and 2000 Horſe, and ſend them towards <hi>York,</hi> hoping they would increaſe by others coming to them: And they borrowed a ſufficient ſumme of Money from the <hi>Londoners,</hi> who ſtrove who ſhould bring moſt of their ſilver and guilt Plate, and whatſoever pretious things they had, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of great advantage they ſhould receive by it. But the Kings misfortune began, when 20000 pounds were detain'd by the Exchange, being publiſhed at <hi>London,</hi> which the Queen had borrowed with the Crown Jewels laid to pawn; this was a mighty ſtop to the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. The Houſes increaſed the more, who (ſome in vain being angry at it) endeavoured to raiſe a great Army. The King alſo, who had
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:119698:141"/>with advice made delaies, and ſpun out the time, could no longer wink at theſe preparations for Warre, but by Letters, by Policy, by open Warre, he did preſs the buſineſs unceſſantly, and with great impatience. And he politiquely attempts to take <hi>Hull,</hi> having obtain'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of ſome of the Garriſon. But <hi>Hotham</hi> who commanded the Garriſon, refuſing to let him in, though many Souldiers ran away, yet by a freſh ſupply of the <hi>Scots,</hi> he was diſappointed. Becauſe this ſucceeded not, he turns about to make conditions for Peace, and he offered the Houſes to come preſently to them, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſeverely the Authors of diſagreement, ſo they would leave <hi>London</hi> that ſeditious City, and choſe ſome other place, as <hi>Oxford, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, Cambridge, York, Briſtol, Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> for to aſſmble at. But the Houſes would name no other place, leaſt the City of <hi>London</hi> ſhould be diſpleaſed at it, for they had more need of the <hi>Londoners</hi> than of any others. The King, when that would not take, proclaims all men guilty of Treaſon, who ſhould aſſiſt the Houſes with Money, or any other ſupplies; and he threatens the <hi>Londoners</hi> that if they did it, they ſhould loſe all their priviledges (as they have very great ones.) The Houſes on the other ſide ſet as good a gloſs upon their Cauſe as they were able to do. Mens mindes and inclinations
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:119698:141"/>were diſtracted by theſe means. The people who are eaſily led by blinde errour, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearances, ſtuck faſt to the Parliaments cauſe. Others who were of a higher rank, by reaſon of their Families, paid Tribute freely, leaſt the Houſes ſhould ſend men to ſtrain on their Shops, under a colour of neceſſity: All the Nobles almoſt held with the King.</p>
               <p>The King in the mean while fortifies <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi> and <hi>Barwick</hi> with Garriſons of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> wherein doubtleſs he hurt himſelf, and aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the hearts of the <hi>Scots</hi> from him. For it was agreed upon before to have them kept by the <hi>Scotch</hi> ſouldiers, and not by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But when help came from other parts, and the <hi>Scots</hi> were undervalued, they ſtudied to advantage themſelves only, and though by holding forth Peace, he had won many mens hearts, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven by deſpair, he attempts by force to gain <hi>Hull,</hi> which he could not do by Policy. Firſt he poſſeſſed himſelf of their Fals of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and then of their publick Waies, that the Towns men might want neceſſaries, but by their Courage and Valour he loſt his labour. The Houſes now Proclaimed openly Warres; and they made the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Generall of the Foot, <hi>Bedford</hi> of the Horſe. The King makes the Earl of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> a very Noble man, and faithfull to his Soveraign, Generall of his Horſe,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:119698:142"/>and in the mean time ſet forth his Declarations to the world, and requiring <hi>Hull</hi> to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to him, that he might puniſh the inſolence of the Governour, but nothing prevailed. But that Warre Proclaimed might not want its ſolemnities, the King ſet up his Standard firſt at <hi>Nottingham.</hi> But when he ſaw a ſmaller concourſe of men than he believed would have been, he again turns about to make conditions. He ſent Meſſengers to the Houſes to excuſe the fact, and to deſire Articles of Peace. But the Houſes, who knew that this proceeded more from his neceſſity than love, made uſe of all advantages, cauſing the Kings Commiſſioners to be brought as Delinquents before the Parliament, overthrowing by this means the Law of Nations.</p>
               <p>Then they ſend to the King that unleſs he came ſpeedily to <hi>London,</hi> and ſent away thoſe Nobles to the Parliament that were fled from them, that they might be tried for their Lives, and their Eſtates might be confiſcate to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Army, they would never lay down their Arms. A very hard condition, and no waies to be anſwered but by the ſword. Some there were that counſelled the King to yield to this, but he had yet courage remaining. After ſo many great preambles, at length Warre is denounced.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:119698:142"/>
               <p>But we ſhall pull in our ſails, unfolding the cauſes of theſe diſſentions briefly and ſuccinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we reſolved at firſt, and ſo haſten to a concluſion, leaſt entring afreſh into a large field, we ſhould tire both our ſelves and the Reader. Pardon therefore this long digreſſion, and I ſhall proceed.</p>
               <p>It was now come to open Warre, and the Victory was doubtfull, ſometimes falling on this ſide, ſometimes on that, with no ſmall loſs of blood on both ſides. All the particulars are ſet down at large in Books written to this purpoſe, whither I remit the Reader that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires further knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſſex</hi> was Generall of the Parliament For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Fairfax</hi> he ſucceeded in his place. Divers Battels were fought here and there, many Towns vanquiſhed: For the greateſt part the King had the worſt of it, who was afterwards alſo beſieged at <hi>Oxford</hi> by <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and was conſtrained to fly away in a diſguiſed habit, and he came to the <hi>Scots</hi> that were at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arke,</hi> hoping to be received with great huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by ſuch good ſubjects as they boaſted themſelves to be.</p>
               <p>But when both Fortune and Fidelity failed, and there was no care taken for him in his affliction. They when they could not be good, would not be bad, and to keep their
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:119698:143"/>hands clear, they delivered the King to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> under thoſe conditions (as they ſay) that no violence ſhould be offered to his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> being now Maſters of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, carry the King to <hi>Holnbey</hi> Caſtle, from thence to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, whither he had fled before for Refuge, now a Priſon. Which place ſeeming not ſafe enough for him, he went away to the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> to be guarded by the Waters and Colonel <hi>Hammon:</hi> uſing a crafty excuſe, for a certain Letter was left on the Table, whereby the King was advertiſed, that there were ſome that laid wait for his life, whereby he was frighted, and fled to a ſafe place in the Iſle of <hi>Wight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The people, though before they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged againſt the King, now pitying his caſe, and ſeeing their errors, reſolved to plead his Cauſe: They offer their humble Petitions to the Houſes, that they would not refuſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to make peace with the King, and they prevailed ſo farre, that at laſt the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs came to a Treaty, with a great deal of ſeeming ſatisfaction on both ſides with great applauſe, both of the King, the Houſes and the People; but afterward there was an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Petition exhibited to the Parliament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they deſired that the King might be tried by
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:119698:143"/>the Laws and Juſtice, and all further Treaties with him to be laid aſide, to which they denied to give an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>The Army and ſome of the Parliament not being ſatisfied, they march partly toward <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> to the King, who now was a Priſoner at large, and conveyed him into <hi>Hurſt</hi> Caſtle; Then marching toward <hi>London</hi> again, they poſſeſſed themſelves of the City, and caſt ſome of the Houſes into Priſon, whilſt the reſt who foreſaw this Tempeſt, ſaved themſelves by flight. Here we may ſee an example of Gods judgement, for they that before had ill treated their Maſter, are now compelled to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>All that conſented to the <hi>non</hi>-addreſſes, are reſtored to their Honours and Places. Then the King, in the year 1648. was taken as a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner of Warre, and carried to <hi>Windſor.</hi> The remainder of the Parliament with others, erect a new and unheard of Tribunal, to take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the Kings caſe. Judges were choſen, whoſe Names are generally known.</p>
               <p>This was done in the year 1649. in <hi>January.</hi> The King was brought before the High-Court of Juſtice, and was accuſed of theſe Crimes:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he gave the cauſe of the cruell bloodſhed in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he had born Armes againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:119698:144"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he had given Commiſſions to his Sonne and others to wage Warre, that he might exalt his own Authority, with the high detriment of the Commonwealth, whence they concluded, that he was guilty of Treaſon, and ſo he was a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, a Tyrant, and an Enemy to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King ſmiled at all theſe things, and gave no anſwer: being further urged, he refuſed to give any anſwer.</p>
               <p>Whereupon they proceed to Sentence, <hi>That he was fallen from all his Dignities, was guilty of High-Treaſon, and therefore was to loſe his Head for being a Tyrant, a Robber, and an Enemy to the Commonwealth.</hi> Some making a great ſhout.</p>
               <p>The Sentence given, they proceed to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, though the <hi>Holland</hi> Embaſſadours, <hi>Adrian Paw,</hi> and <hi>Albertus Joachimus,</hi> with the <hi>Scots,</hi> did their beſt to hinder the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. He obtained leave for D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Juxton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and two of his Children to be with him, theſe for his bodies, him for the comfort of his ſoul. At length he ſent away his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with Gifts and Tears: only he kept the Miniſter by him, to the laſt moment of his life. The Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> came to bid the King their laſt farewell, but the King refuſed it, leaſt they ſhould interrupt
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:119698:144"/>the preſent joys of his ſoul with new lamenting. At laſt the 30 day of <hi>January</hi> was appointed for his execution: And the King aſcended the Scaffold erected before his Banqueting-houſe; from whence he made his laſt Speech to the People there preſent, and when as now he had ſufficiently profeſſed his Innocency, he then prepared himſelf for death, and laying his neck on the Block, his Head was cut off by a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed Executioner, and he changed a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome life for a quiet death: In the Year 1649.</p>
